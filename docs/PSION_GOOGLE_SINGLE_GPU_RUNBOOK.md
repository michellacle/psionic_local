# Psion Google Single-GPU Runbook

> Status: canonical `PSION-44` / `#410` runbook, written 2026-03-22 after the
> Google launch bundle, immutable input package, checkpoint archive, host
> observability finalizer, and validation folders landed on `main`.

This runbook is the operator entrypoint for the first truthful Google-hosted
`Psion` pilot.

It is intentionally narrow:

- one project: `openagentsgemini`
- one region family: `us-central1`
- one node at a time
- one Google Compute Engine VM, not a trusted cluster
- one bounded reference-pilot lane with retained evidence

It does not claim broader pretraining completion, trusted-cluster readiness,
cross-region orchestration, or production serving readiness for trained
checkpoints.

## Canonical Artifacts

  `fixtures/psion/google/psion_google_single_node_launch_profiles_v1.json`

## Local Requirements

Required local commands:

- `gcloud`
- `bq`
- `jq`
- `git`

Minimum local CLI versions:

- `gcloud >= 470.0.0`
- `bq >= 2.1.0`

Current validated local versions at the time this runbook landed:

- `gcloud 556.0.0`
- `bq 2.1.28`

Required auth posture:

- active `gcloud` account must be able to mint an access token
- active `gcloud` project must be `openagentsgemini`
- the operator must be able to read
  `gs://openagentsgemini-psion-train-us-central1`
- the operator must be able to read
  `openagentsgemini:psion_training_finops`
- the operator must be able to describe
  `psion-train-single-node@openagentsgemini.iam.gserviceaccount.com`

Environment variables:

- no override is required for the default lane
- optional overrides:
  `PROJECT_ID`, `PROFILE_ID`, `ZONE`, `RUN_ID`, `INSTANCE_NAME`
- this runbook only authorizes `PROJECT_ID=openagentsgemini`

Secret posture:

- prefer attached-service-account access on the VM
- do not inject runtime secrets unless strictly required by a later issue
- if a future run depends on one secret, record the dependency in the launch or
  follow-up audit without recording the secret value

## Claim Boundary

This runbook covers one bounded Google single-node pilot only.

It still refuses to claim:

- trusted-cluster training
- cross-region or multi-node training
- arbitrary machine-family support beyond the committed launch profiles
- broad cost optimality across Google GPU families
- broader pretraining completion for `Psion`

## 1. Local Preflight

Run the repo-owned operator gate before any paid launch:

```bash
bash scripts/psion-google-operator-preflight.sh --profile g2_l4_single_node
```

Optional explicit zone override:

```bash
bash scripts/psion-google-operator-preflight.sh \
  --profile g2_l4_single_node \
  --zone us-central1-a
```

This command rejects:

- missing local CLI dependencies
- stale `gcloud` or `bq`
- missing or mismatched `gcloud` auth
- missing bucket access
- missing BigQuery FinOps access
- missing training service-account visibility
- quota-unready launch profiles

Do not continue if the result is not `ready`.

## 2. Optional Manifest-Only Rehearsal

Before the paid launch, you may upload only the launch manifest, startup-script
snapshot, and quota-preflight receipt:

```bash
RUN_ID="psion-g2-l4-$(date -u +%Y%m%dt%H%M%Sz | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')"

bash scripts/psion-google-launch-single-node.sh \
  --manifest-only \
  --run-id "${RUN_ID}" \
  --instance-name "${RUN_ID}"
```

Expected launch artifacts:

- `gs://openagentsgemini-psion-train-us-central1/runs/${RUN_ID}/launch/psion_google_single_node_launch_manifest.json`
- `gs://openagentsgemini-psion-train-us-central1/runs/${RUN_ID}/launch/psion-google-single-node-startup.sh`
- `gs://openagentsgemini-psion-train-us-central1/runs/${RUN_ID}/launch/psion_google_quota_preflight.json`

## 3. Paid Launch

Default first lane:

- profile: `g2_l4_single_node`
- fallback order:
  `us-central1-a`, `us-central1-b`, `us-central1-c`

Launch:

```bash
RUN_ID="psion-g2-l4-$(date -u +%Y%m%dt%H%M%Sz | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')"

bash scripts/psion-google-launch-single-node.sh \
  --profile g2_l4_single_node \
  --run-id "${RUN_ID}" \
  --instance-name "${RUN_ID}"
```

What happens:

- the launcher resolves the pinned GPU image from
  `deeplearning-platform-release`
- one launch manifest is uploaded before the VM request
- the VM boots without an external IP on `oa-lightning`
- the startup script owns bootstrap, repo checkout, input materialization,
  training, checkpoint archive, cold restore, and final evidence upload

If `gcloud compute instances create` fails before the VM exists, the launch
folder still retains:

- a typed `launch_capacity_failure` final manifest
- the launch-failure log
- the launch manifest, startup snapshot, and quota-preflight receipt

## 4. Monitoring

Describe the instance:

```bash
gcloud compute instances describe "${RUN_ID}" \
  --project=openagentsgemini \
  --zone=us-central1-a \
  --format='value(status)'
```

IAP SSH if you need interactive inspection:

```bash
gcloud compute ssh "${RUN_ID}" \
  --project=openagentsgemini \
  --zone=us-central1-a \
  --tunnel-through-iap
```

Watch the run folder:

```bash
gcloud storage ls \
  "gs://openagentsgemini-psion-train-us-central1/runs/${RUN_ID}/**"
```

Expected host-emitted artifacts:

- `host/psion_google_host_facts.json`
- `host/psion_google_runtime_snapshot.json`
- `host/psion_google_gpu_summary.json`
- `host/psion_google_run_timeline.json`
- `host/psion_google_run_outcome.json`
- `logs/psion_google_run_events.jsonl`
- `logs/training.stdout.log`
- `logs/training.stderr.log`
- `logs/psion_google_gpu_samples.csv`
- `receipts/...`
- `artifacts/psion_reference_pilot_checkpoint.safetensors`
- `final/psion_google_run_manifest_of_manifests.json`
- `final/psion_google_run_final_manifest.json`

## 5. Checkpoint Archive And Restore

The host startup now runs these automatically after a green reference-pilot
bundle:

- `scripts/psion-google-archive-reference-pilot-checkpoint.sh`
- `scripts/psion-google-cold-restore-reference-pilot.sh`

Operator verification after the run:

```bash
gcloud storage cat \
  "gs://openagentsgemini-psion-train-us-central1/runs/${RUN_ID}/final/psion_google_run_final_manifest.json" \
  | jq '.checkpoint_recovery'
```

Manual restore drill against a known archive manifest remains available:

```bash
bash scripts/psion-google-cold-restore-reference-pilot.sh \
  "gs://openagentsgemini-psion-train-us-central1/checkpoints/reference_pilot/psion-reference-pilot-run/psion-reference-pilot-step-16/archive/psion_google_reference_checkpoint_archive_manifest.json"
```

Do not treat local VM disks as durable checkpoint authority. The archive
manifest and cold-restore manifest are the durable recovery surfaces.

## 6. Evidence Bundle Verification

The single source of truth after the VM is gone is:

```bash
gcloud storage cat \
  "gs://openagentsgemini-psion-train-us-central1/runs/${RUN_ID}/final/psion_google_run_final_manifest.json" \
  | jq '.result_classification, .timeline, .manifest_of_manifests, .retained_objects | length'
```

What the final manifest must preserve:

- launch topology and machine profile
- image identity
- input package bindings and digests
- host facts and runtime snapshot
- GPU summary and raw GPU samples
- structured event log plus stdout and stderr
- pilot receipts and benchmark outputs
- checkpoint archive and cold-restore references
- one manifest-of-manifests checksum
- one retained-object list with per-object digests

Deletion is refused by default if the final manifest is missing.

## 7. Teardown

After the final manifest exists:

```bash
bash scripts/psion-google-delete-single-node.sh --run-id "${RUN_ID}"
```

Only bypass the retention guard if you are intentionally preserving a failed
partial launch folder and the VM is already absent:

```bash
bash scripts/psion-google-delete-single-node.sh --run-id "${RUN_ID}" --force
```

## 8. Known Refusals After The First Google Run

Even after one successful bounded Google run, this repo still refuses to claim:

- multi-node data parallel or model parallel Google training
- cross-region or failover-ready Google orchestration
- trusted-cluster promotion
- broader `Psion` pretraining completion
- production serving readiness for the resulting checkpoint

Those claims stay blocked on later issues and later audits.
