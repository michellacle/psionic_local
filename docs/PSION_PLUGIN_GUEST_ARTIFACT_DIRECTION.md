# PSION Plugin Guest-Artifact Direction

This document freezes the product direction for guest-artifact plugin support
in the Psion plugin convergence program.

## Decision

Guest-artifact restoration remains a **later separate bounded lane**.

It is still worth keeping in the program, but only under a narrow internal
training and evaluation posture.

It does **not** describe current starter-plugin truth.

The current live plugin substrate is:

- host-native
- operator-internal
- runtime-owned
- receipt-backed
- publication-blocked

That substrate now includes:

- the capability-free local deterministic user-authored path
- one manual `networked_read_only` user-authored proof

It does not include live guest-artifact loading.

## Why This Decision Exists

The historical alpha planning note kept a future user-provided Wasm lane open.
The current repo, however, has converged on a host-native starter-plugin
platform first.

Without this decision record, historical guest-artifact planning language can
be misread as current product truth.

This doc closes that ambiguity:

- guest-artifact support remains intentionally later
- host-native starter plugins remain the only present-tense plugin substrate
- any future guest-artifact tranche must earn its own bounded contracts and
  evidence

## Required Boundary For Any Future Guest-Artifact Lane

If the repo restores guest artifacts later, that lane must remain:

- digest-bound
- trust-tiered
- authority-gated
- receipt-equivalent
- replay-explicit
- publication-blocked
- operator-internal until a later explicit publication tranche says otherwise

The future lane must not rely on:

- floating artifact identity
- implicit runtime loading
- silent trust inheritance from host-native starter plugins
- public plugin marketplace language
- arbitrary external binary execution claims

## Direction For The Follow-On Issues

The next guest-artifact issues remain valid only inside this bounded direction:

1. digest-bound manifest and identity contract
2. bounded runtime loading path
3. receipt-equivalent invocation path
4. one user-provided Wasm plugin end to end
5. trust-tier and authority-gate rows

Those issues are for one narrow admitted guest-artifact class only.

The first concrete contract for that lane now lives in:

- `docs/PSION_PLUGIN_GUEST_ARTIFACT_MANIFEST.md`
- `crates/psionic-runtime/src/psion_plugin_guest_artifact_manifest.rs`

They are not authorization for:

- generic Wasm plugin support
- arbitrary user binary support
- publication widening
- universality claims

## Non-Goals

This decision record does not:

- add guest-artifact runtime loading
- add a manifest implementation
- add a user-provided Wasm plugin
- change the current served capability matrix
- widen publication or serving posture

## Current Honest Summary Language

Allowed:

- “guest-artifact restoration remains a later separate bounded lane”
- “current plugin truth is still host-native starter plugins only”
- “any future guest-artifact path must be digest-bound, trust-tiered, and
  publication-blocked”

Disallowed:

- “the repo supports Wasm plugins” in the present tense
- “user-provided plugins are supported” without class qualifiers
- “guest plugins are part of the current starter-plugin platform”
