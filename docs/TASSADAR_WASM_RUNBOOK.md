# Tassadar Wasm Runbook

> Status: canonical bounded-Wasm operator runbook, added 2026-03-18 after
> reviewing `README.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`,
> `docs/ROADMAP_TASSADAR.md`, `docs/ROADMAP_TASSADAR_INDEX.md`, and the
> current committed Tassadar Wasm reports.

## Purpose

This runbook is the operator entrypoint for the current bounded Tassadar Wasm
flow.

It exists to answer a narrow question:

> from a clean checkout, what should I run to verify the real bounded Wasm lane
> and how should I interpret success, refusal, and drift?

## Scope

This runbook covers the current repo-owned bounded Wasm flow only:

- Rust-only article frontend canon
- Rust-to-Wasm article profile completeness matrix
- canonical C-to-Wasm compile receipt
- source-to-Wasm-to-Tassadar compile-pipeline matrix
- normalized Wasm-module ingress
- differential Wasm conformance against `wasmi`
- module-scale Wasm workload suite
- trap and exception parity

It does not claim:

- arbitrary Wasm closure
- broad parameter-ABI closure
- broad host-import closure
- broad C/C++ frontend closure

## Preconditions

Start from a clean checkout:

```bash
git status --short --branch
```

Required local baseline:

- Rust toolchain that can build the workspace
- normal `cargo run` and `cargo test` access

Optional local baseline:

- `clang` with a working `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target if you want the
  historical C-source compile receipt to succeed locally

If that target is missing, the compile-receipt step should refuse with a typed
`toolchain_failure`. That is a local toolchain prerequisite failure, not proof
that the bounded Wasm lane regressed.

## Canonical Flow

### 1. Rust-only article frontend canon

```bash
cargo run -p psionic-eval --example tassadar_rust_source_canon_report
```

Read:

- `fixtures/tassadar/reports/tassadar_rust_source_canon_report.json`

Expected outcome:

- all canonical frontend cases are rooted in committed `.rs` fixtures
- the multi-export, memory-lookup, parameter-ABI, micro-kernel, heap-input,
  long-loop, Hungarian, and Sudoku Rust fixtures all compile successfully to
  committed Wasm outputs with stable source/toolchain/config/output lineage
- this report is the article-closure frontend anchor; it does not by itself
  imply arbitrary Rust closure or arbitrary Wasm lowering

### 2. Rust-to-Wasm article profile completeness matrix

```bash
cargo run -p psionic-eval --example tassadar_rust_article_profile_completeness_report
```

Read:

- `fixtures/tassadar/reports/tassadar_rust_article_profile_completeness_report.json`

Expected outcome:

- one machine-readable supported/refused matrix over module shape, control
  flow, tables/globals/indirect calls, numeric families, and ABI shape
- the current Rust-only article family is explicit as a bounded i32-first
  profile rather than inferred from several narrower artifacts
- the same profile boundary is what the Tassadar environment bundle and served
  capability publication now cite

### 3. Optional historical C-to-Wasm compile receipt

```bash
cargo run -p psionic-runtime --example tassadar_c_to_wasm_compile_receipt
```

Read:

- `fixtures/tassadar/reports/tassadar_c_to_wasm_compile_receipt.json`

Expected outcome:

- either a successful canonical lineage receipt over
  `fixtures/tassadar/sources/tassadar_micro_wasm_kernel.c`
- or a typed refusal if the local `clang` cannot target
  `wasm32-unknown-unknown`
- this step is not required for the Rust-only article-closure path

### 4. Compile-pipeline matrix

```bash
cargo run -p psionic-eval --example tassadar_compile_pipeline_matrix_report
```

Read:

- `fixtures/tassadar/reports/tassadar_compile_pipeline_matrix_report.json`

Expected outcome:

- exact lowering for the multi-export arithmetic and memory-lookup WAT cases
- explicit `unsupported_param_count` refusal for the parameter-ABI WAT case
- explicit toolchain refusal for the C-source path when the local toolchain is
  unavailable or incomplete

### 5. Wasm-module ingress

```bash
cargo run -p psionic-eval --example tassadar_wasm_module_ingress_report
```

Read:

- `fixtures/tassadar/reports/tassadar_wasm_module_ingress_report.json`

Expected outcome:

- the real committed Wasm binary parses, normalizes, and round-trips, but still
  refuses lowering because the exported function takes one parameter
- the seeded synthetic multi-function module lowers and executes exactly

### 6. Differential Wasm conformance

```bash
cargo run -p psionic-eval --example tassadar_wasm_conformance_report
```

Read:

- `fixtures/tassadar/reports/tassadar_wasm_conformance_report.json`

Expected outcome:

- exact success on the current supported i32 global/table/call-indirect subset
- exact trap parity on the seeded trap cases
- explicit boundary refusal on the unsupported host-import case

### 7. Module-scale Wasm workloads

```bash
cargo run -p psionic-eval --example tassadar_module_scale_workload_suite_report
```

Read:

- `fixtures/tassadar/reports/tassadar_module_scale_workload_suite_report.json`

Expected outcome:

- exact lowering for fixed-span memcpy, checksum, parsing, and VM-style cases
- explicit parameter-ABI refusal on the VM-style parameter case

### 8. Trap and exception parity

```bash
cargo run -p psionic-eval --example tassadar_trap_exception_report
```

Read:

- `fixtures/tassadar/reports/tassadar_trap_exception_report.json`
- `fixtures/tassadar/reports/tassadar_trap_exception_runtime_report.json`

Expected outcome:

- one success-parity control row
- explicit trap parity for bounds faults and indirect-call failures
- explicit refusal parity for malformed imports and unsupported profiles
- `drift_case_count = 0`

## Validation Commands

Run the focused report checks after the flow:

```bash
cargo test -p psionic-eval wasm_module_ingress -- --nocapture
cargo test -p psionic-eval wasm_conformance -- --nocapture
cargo test -p psionic-eval module_scale_workload_suite -- --nocapture
cargo test -p psionic-eval trap_exception -- --nocapture
```

These checks should keep the committed reports and generated truth aligned.

## How To Interpret Results

- If only the C-to-Wasm receipt refuses and the refusal is a typed local
  toolchain failure, the bounded Wasm lane can still be healthy.
- If the compile-pipeline matrix loses the exact WAT cases, that is a real
  lowering regression.
- If the ingress report stops lowering the seeded synthetic module exactly, that
  is a real bounded module-lane regression.
- If the conformance report loses exact success or trap parity on the supported
  subset, that is a real execution-truth regression.
- If the module-scale suite loses exactness on memcpy, checksum, parsing, or
  VM-style fixed-operand cases, that is a real workload-suite regression.
- If trap parity or refusal parity drifts in the trap report, the widened Wasm
  claim has a semantic hole even if success cases still look green.

## Cleanup Rule

The compile-receipt step can rewrite
`fixtures/tassadar/reports/tassadar_c_to_wasm_compile_receipt.json` if the
local toolchain differs from the committed environment.

If your task is only to validate the current bounded Wasm lane and not to
change the canonical receipt, restore that file before commit:

```bash
git restore --source=HEAD -- fixtures/tassadar/reports/tassadar_c_to_wasm_compile_receipt.json
```

## Exit Gate

Treat the current bounded Wasm flow as healthy only when all of the following
hold:

- the compile-pipeline, ingress, conformance, module-scale, and trap reports
  reproduce without unexpected drift
- the focused tests above pass
- any local C-toolchain failure stays typed and explicit instead of silently
  widening or corrupting the lane
- `git status --short --branch` is clean before you leave the checkout
