# Psionic Parameter Golf Exported Submission Evidence

> Status: canonical `PGOLF-603` / `#190` exported-folder evidence and
> replay-verification contract, updated 2026-03-24 after landing
> `crates/psionic-train/src/parameter_golf_submission_pr.rs`.

This document records the challenge-facing evidence Psionic now preserves from
the exported submission folder itself.

## What Landed

`psionic-train` now exposes:

- `ParameterGolfSubmissionRunEvidenceReport`
- `ParameterGolfRecordFolderReplayVerificationReport`
- `build_parameter_golf_submission_run_evidence_report(...)`
- `build_parameter_golf_record_folder_replay_verification_report(...)`
- `write_parameter_golf_submission_run_evidence_report(...)`
- `write_parameter_golf_record_folder_replay_verification_report(...)`

The repo now also ships:

- `scripts/check-parameter-golf-record-folder-replay.sh`
- `fixtures/parameter_golf/reports/parameter_golf_submission_run_evidence.json`
- `fixtures/parameter_golf/reports/parameter_golf_record_folder_replay_verification.json`

## Exported-Folder Evidence

The run-evidence report now binds one exported folder to:

- the exact shipped `train_gpt.py`, runtime payload, runtime manifest, train
  log, model artifact, accounting receipt, benchmark receipt, run bundle, and
  runtime receipt digests
- one real folder-local entrypoint execution
- the preserved bounded wallclock, memory, and artifact-size receipts
- one measured-or-refused `8xH100` challenge receipt for the same folder

The exported folder now also carries the real single-H100 trainer payload, the
real-execution contract, and the immutable PGOLF input-package descriptor. The
current replay verifier still exercises only the default bounded local-
reference mode; later remote evidence binds those extra shipped bytes to the
same exported-folder surface rather than introducing a second package shape.

That closes the earlier gap where these facts existed only on the internal
benchmark path instead of on the exported folder surface itself.

The canonical exported folder now also freezes the bounded local-reference
wallclock receipt to one committed reference measurement so the generated
non-record evidence bundle stays deterministic across reruns. That stability is
for replay and accounting review only; it is not a challenge-speed claim.

The single-H100 trainer surface now mirrors the same final
`int8+zlib`-roundtrip metric posture: the live pre-export validation may still
be preserved for diagnosis, but the contest-facing final `val_loss` and
`val_bpb` are bound to the exported compressed artifact plus its digest and
roundtrip eval time.

The repo now also preserves one explicit export-surface judgment alongside
those evidence receipts. That report answers a different question than replay:
whether the current shipped folder is literally faithful to the README
`train_gpt.py` surface, or whether it instead asks maintainers to review an
explicit launcher-plus-runtime equivalence argument tied to exact shipped
bytes.

## Replay Verification

The replay verifier now checks the exported folder directly:

- `submission.json` versus the final `train.log` metrics
- `submission.json` versus the preserved benchmark receipt metrics
- `submission.json` versus the runtime receipt metrics
- `submission.json.wallclock_seconds` versus the preserved benchmark receipt
- counted-byte facts versus the shipped accounting receipt and actual file sizes

Run the verifier from the folder root:

```bash
scripts/check-parameter-golf-record-folder-replay.sh
```

Target another folder and preserve the report:

```bash
scripts/check-parameter-golf-record-folder-replay.sh \
  --submission-dir /tmp/records/track_non_record_16mb/<submission_id> \
  --report /tmp/parameter_golf_record_folder_replay_verification.json
```

Generate the exported-folder evidence report directly:

```bash
cargo run -p psionic-train --example parameter_golf_submission_run_evidence \
  /tmp/records/track_non_record_16mb/<submission_id> \
  /tmp/parameter_golf_submission_run_evidence.json
```

Bind the same exported folder to the RunPod `8xH100` operator posture:

```bash
cargo run -p psionic-train --example parameter_golf_submission_run_evidence \
  /tmp/records/track_non_record_16mb/<submission_id> \
  /tmp/parameter_golf_submission_run_evidence.json \
  --posture runpod_8xh100
```

Bind the same exported folder to a real measured distributed receipt from the
RunPod `8xH100` lane:

```bash
cargo run -p psionic-train --example parameter_golf_submission_run_evidence \
  /tmp/records/track_non_record_16mb/<submission_id> \
  /tmp/parameter_golf_submission_run_evidence.json \
  --posture runpod_8xh100 \
  --distributed-receipt /tmp/parameter_golf_distributed_8xh100_receipt.json
```

## Current Honest Boundary

These reports close exported-folder evidence and replay verification only.

They do not claim:

- that real exported-folder `8xH100` evidence exists
- that the current committed evidence is a true `8xH100` success
- that the remaining CUDA baseline blockers are retired
- that the current non-record folder is record-ready

The current committed challenge receipt is still a refusal on the local
single-`RTX 4080` review host. The later RunPod `8xH100` posture now binds the
same exported folder to challenge-matching inventory, but it still records a
measurements-missing refusal until real distributed timing and memory evidence
lands. When a real distributed receipt exists, the same report surface can now
embed it directly instead of regenerating a synthetic refusal. That is
intentional: the point of this layer is to make the folder-facing evidence and
refusal posture explicit rather than implied.
