This document records the current honest trainer posture for the Psionic
Parameter Golf single-H100 lane.

It is narrower than the real `8xH100` record lane, but it now follows the
same public single-device control-loop shape as `train_gpt.py` by default.

## What Landed

`psionic-train` now exposes:

- `ParameterGolfSingleH100TrainingConfig`
- `ParameterGolfSingleH100TrainingDisposition`
- `ParameterGolfSingleH100TrainingReport`
- `ParameterGolfSingleH100LiveVisualizationWriter`
- `build_parameter_golf_single_h100_training_report(...)`
- `write_parameter_golf_single_h100_training_report(...)`
- `parameter_golf_single_h100_visualization` as a Rust materializer for the
  provider-neutral app mirror
- `parameter_golf_single_h100_train` as a Rust binary entrypoint

That means the repo now owns one real Rust entrypoint for the public
single-device baseline path rather than only the narrower bring-up seam and the
older bounded local-reference trainer.

## Command

The binary defaults to the local `~/code/parameter-golf` clone paths from the
public README and now enters the widened challenge-style control loop when no
explicit step cap is passed:

```bash
cargo run -q -p psionic-train --bin parameter_golf_single_h100_train
```

You can also pass the explicit cached-dataset and tokenizer paths, an output
report path, an explicit bounded proof step count, and an optional explicit
final-validation mode:

```bash
cargo run -q -p psionic-train --bin parameter_golf_single_h100_train -- \
  ~/code/parameter-golf/data/datasets/fineweb10B_sp1024 \
  ~/code/parameter-golf/data/tokenizers/fineweb_1024_bpe.model \
  /tmp/parameter_golf_single_h100_training.json \
  1 \
  roundtrip_only
```

Passing the final positional step count selects the old bounded proof posture:

- `warmup_steps=0`
- `validation_loss_every=0`
- `train_log_every=1`
- default `final_validation_mode=roundtrip_only`
- no wallclock stop cap

Omitting that positional step count selects the widened baseline posture:

- `max_steps=20_000`
- `warmup_steps=20`
- `validation_loss_every=1000`
- `train_log_every=200`
- default `final_validation_mode=both`
- `max_wallclock_seconds=600`

Supported explicit final-validation modes are:

- `live_only`
- `roundtrip_only`
- `both`

For bounded same-node validation-runtime comparisons, the repo also exposes:

```bash
cargo run -q -p psionic-train --bin parameter_golf_validation_runtime_receipt -- \
  ~/code/parameter-golf/data/datasets/fineweb10B_sp1024 \
  ~/code/parameter-golf/data/tokenizers/fineweb_1024_bpe.model \
  /tmp/parameter_golf_validation_runtime_comparison.json \
  8 \
  2
```

That sidecar receipt is intentionally a local runtime comparison tool, not a
contest metric surface.

## Data Setup

This doc assumes the public challenge cache has already been downloaded into
the local `~/code/parameter-golf` clone using the public README workflow:

```bash
cd ~/code/parameter-golf
.venv/bin/python data/cached_challenge_fineweb.py --variant sp1024
```

On the current local machine, that populates:

- `data/datasets/fineweb10B_sp1024/`
- `data/tokenizers/fineweb_1024_bpe.model`
- `data/tokenizers/fineweb_1024_bpe.vocab`

## What The Command Binds

The command is explicit about what it treats as trainer truth. It binds:

- the local cached FineWeb `sp1024` shard directory into a versioned
  `DatasetManifest`
- the local tokenizer file into a machine-readable `TokenizerDigest`
- the local CUDA inventory into explicit single-H100 machine-admission truth
  using the repo-owned CUDA discovery substrate
- the public single-device batch geometry from
  `ParameterGolfBatchGeometry::challenge_single_device_defaults()`
- the public baseline `9x512` model contract and optimizer-plan digest
- integer token ids directly into the lowered graph, where token embedding
  lookup now happens on-device rather than through a host-owned embedded-input
  `Vec<f32>` gather before each train or validation batch
- integer target ids directly into the on-device projection-loss path rather
  than routing them through dense `f32` target tensors
- the upstream mixed-precision optimizer split at the trainer-state boundary:
  BF16 train-visible embeddings and matrix weights, FP32 control tensors, and
  FP32 master weights for the Adam-managed embedding/head groups
- BF16 graph inputs for the train-visible token-embedding and linear weight
  surface, with the CUDA path now widening BF16 embedding tables and casting
  F32 activations to BF16 on-device before the existing BF16 matmul lane so
  the hot-path weight residency is no longer dense `f32` end to end
- BF16 autodiff admission for that same train-visible weight surface, so the
  single-H100 backward launcher now binds retained BF16 primal values and BF16
  seed or gradient tensors through the graph-declared dtype instead of
  silently forcing the hot path back to dense `f32`
- the same single-device warmup-and-restore, repeated-step, periodic
  validation, train-log, and wallclock-stop control-loop shape the public
  `train_gpt.py` path uses
- one measured CUDA training run when the machine and CUDA-capability
  contracts are satisfied
- preserved initial, periodic, and final validation receipts directly from the
  Psionic path, with an explicit `final_validation_mode` telling the report and
  logs whether the last-step live-model validation, the exported int8+zlib
  roundtrip validation, or both were requested
- a device-resident validation runner that keeps the stable parameter surface
  resident on device across validation batches, reuses mutable token buffers,
  runs through the explicit `parameter_golf_baseline_eval_graph_v1` surface
  instead of the training-graph surface, and records a machine-readable
  validation runtime receipt with the resident parameter buffer count,
  stable-buffer allocation posture, named eval graph surface, token-write
  cost, and byte-accounting cost for each validation pass
- preserved initial, periodic, and final validation receipts directly from the
  Psionic path, with the pre-export live-model validation retained separately
  whenever that posture is requested
- post-step int8-plus-zlib artifact bytes, artifact ref, and artifact digest
- canonical final contest metrics from the exported int8-plus-zlib roundtrip
  artifact, including the preserved roundtrip eval time, when the requested
  final-validation mode includes the roundtrip pass
- stop reason plus measured warmup, training, validation, and per-step timing
  receipts so later same-node comparison work can reuse the same trainer report

The report also preserves explicit refusal when:

- the dataset root is missing or malformed
- the tokenizer path is missing
- the machine contract is not one qualifying non-MIG H100
- the committed Parameter Golf CUDA capability report still carries trainer
  blockers

## Live Visualization Mirror

When the trainer receives remote-training metadata through:

- `PSIONIC_REMOTE_TRAINING_PROVIDER`
- `PSIONIC_REMOTE_TRAINING_PROFILE_ID`
- `PSIONIC_REMOTE_TRAINING_LANE_ID`
- `PSIONIC_REMOTE_TRAINING_REPO_REVISION`

it now writes a provider-neutral live mirror beside the trainer report:

- `training_visualization/parameter_golf_single_h100_remote_training_visualization_bundle_v1.json`
- `training_visualization/remote_training_run_index_v1.json`

That mirror updates on the same one-second cadence frozen in
`docs/REMOTE_TRAINING_VISUALIZATION.md`.

It preserves:

- heartbeat truth about the active phase and micro-step position
- retained loss, optimizer-math, and runtime series for every completed step
- local GPU sampling when the host can run `nvidia-smi`
- explicit terminal posture once the trainer report lands

If the trainer report stays absent at finalization time, the materializer keeps
an explicit partial-series fallback from the retained training log instead of
inventing full-series truth.

## Current Honest Boundary

This command is still a single-H100 baseline parity step rather than a stronger
contest claim.

Today the single-H100 trainer doc does **not** claim:

- a Google operator lane
- `8xH100` distributed closure
- leaderboard-speed runtime closure
- record-track accounting closure
- full BF16 activation-kernel closure yet; the current report now records BF16
  graph uploads for the train-visible token-embedding and linear weight path,
  but scalar/control tensors and retained activations remain explicit `f32`
  until the wider BF16 graph-runtime slice lands
- challenge-speed closure; the trainer now reports final contest metrics from
  the exported int8+zlib roundtrip artifact like `train_gpt.py`, but that does
  not by itself make the lane competitive yet

Instead, it gives the repo one narrower but important thing:

- a real Rust-owned single-H100 baseline training command that binds the
  challenge dataset, tokenizer, machine contract, challenge-style control
  loop, validation cadence, stop reason, pre-export live-model validation,
  canonical final int8+zlib roundtrip metrics, and compressed-model accounting
  surfaces into one machine-readable report

The narrower machine-admission seam from
`docs/PARAMETER_GOLF_SINGLE_H100_BRINGUP.md` remains useful, but it is no
longer the only repo-owned single-H100 entrypoint, and the old one-step proof
mode now exists only as an explicit CLI selection for bounded bring-up runs.
