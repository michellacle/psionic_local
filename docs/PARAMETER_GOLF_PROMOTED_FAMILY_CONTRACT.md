# Parameter Golf Promoted Family Contract

## Purpose

This document freezes the family contract for the first serious Psion-owned
small decoder that should be:

- trainable inside `psionic-train`
- exportable as one honest portable bundle
- loadable through a public runtime path
- inferable locally
- serveable through `psionic-serve`

The family is the existing `parameter_golf_decoder` core, not the older toy
`PsionCompactDecoderReferencePilotModel`.

## Frozen Shared Family

Stable family id:

- `parameter_golf_decoder`

Stable first-shipping baseline:

- model id: `parameter-golf-sp1024-9x512`
- revision: `public-2026-03-18`
- config: `9` layers, `512` hidden size, `8` query heads, `4` KV heads,
  `1024` context, tied embeddings, tanh logit softcap, RoPE

Shared capabilities admitted across both promoted profiles:

- tied embeddings
- grouped-query attention with explicit KV-head count
- RoPE
- optional partial RoPE
- learned skip weights / U-Net-like skip structure
- optional `BigramHash`
- optional late-layer value embeddings
- optional XSA on deep layers
- `relu^2`
- `LeakyReLU(0.5)^2`
- parameter-banked weight surfaces
- quantized small-model export

These capabilities are frozen in code at:

- `crates/psionic-models/src/parameter_golf.rs`

## Promoted Profiles

### 1. General Psion Small Decoder

Stable profile id:

- `psion_small_decoder_pgolf_core_v0`

Intent:

- use the PGOLF core architecture as Psionic's first real small decoder
- avoid hard-binding every run to challenge-only contest rules

Challenge-only requirements intentionally disabled:

- exact `SP1024` tokenizer
- exact FineWeb challenge dataset lane
- exact `16 MiB` compressed artifact cap
- score-first TTT
- contest BPB accounting

This is the default profile the train-to-infer PINF stack should target first.

### 2. Strict PGOLF Challenge Overlay

Stable profile id:

- `parameter_golf_challenge_sp1024_v0`

Intent:

- preserve the public Parameter Golf contest posture when Psionic wants to run
  the same core family under the strict challenge rules

Challenge-only requirements enabled:

- exact `SP1024` tokenizer
- exact FineWeb challenge dataset lane
- exact `16 MiB` compressed artifact cap
- legal score-first TTT
- tokenizer-agnostic BPB accounting

This is an overlay profile on the same core family, not a separate core model
family.

## Machine-Readable Surfaces

The promoted-family split is now carried in:

- `ParameterGolfPromotedProfileContract` in
  `crates/psionic-models/src/parameter_golf.rs`
- `PortableModelProfileContract` in
  `crates/psionic-train/src/model_io.rs`
- `parameter_golf_general_psion_small_decoder_profile_contract()` in
  `crates/psionic-train/src/parameter_golf_reference.rs`
- `parameter_golf_strict_challenge_profile_contract()` in
  `crates/psionic-train/src/parameter_golf_reference.rs`

The first canonical promoted training proof path now also exists at:

- `run_parameter_golf_promoted_reference_run(...)` in
  `crates/psionic-train/src/parameter_golf_reference.rs`
- `crates/psionic-train/examples/parameter_golf_promoted_reference_run.rs`

That proof path binds the general promoted profile to the existing full
`parameter_golf_decoder` local-reference trainer, verifies that the emitted
checkpoint tensor surface exactly matches the promoted descriptor, and proves
restore-plus-resume parity from the emitted checkpoint lineage.

The profile split is also carried directly through the training config and
checkpoint manifest:

- `ParameterGolfReferenceTrainingConfig.promoted_profile`
- `ParameterGolfCheckpointManifest.promoted_profile`

The bounded local-reference trainer only admits the general Psion profile. If
the strict challenge overlay is requested before the exact public challenge
tokenizer, FineWeb lane, legal score-first TTT path, contest BPB accounting,
and exported artifact-cap accounting exist, the lane now refuses explicitly
instead of silently pretending those prerequisites are satisfied.

The promoted proof path now also emits one canonical runtime bundle directory
with:

- `parameter_golf_promoted_bundle_manifest.json`
- `descriptor.json`
- `model.safetensors`
- `tokenizer.json`
- `generation_config.json`
- `profile_contract.json`
- `training_config.json`
- `summary.json`
- `checkpoint_manifest.json`
- `checkpoint_surface_report.json`
- `resume_proof.json`

That bundle is checker-backed in `check_parameter_golf_promoted_bundle(...)`
and is now the canonical handoff surface from training into later runtime-load,
prompt, and serve work.

For train-to-infer work, this promoted PGOLF path is now the primary first-model
target. The older `PsionCompactDecoderReferencePilotModel` remains the bounded
smoke-test lane for receipt and pipeline closure only.

The bounded XTRAIN score lane now freezes its own score-law and comparability
boundary at `docs/PARAMETER_GOLF_XTRAIN_TRACK.md` so app-facing viewers do not
mistake the local-reference quick-eval BPB for a public or HOMEGOLF-equivalent
score.

## Scope Boundary

The promoted-family lane still does not itself:

- load the bundle for inference
- run local generation
- wire `psionic-serve`

Those remain the later PINF issues. This document now freezes the family and
profile identity and records the canonical emitted bundle shape that the later
runtime surfaces are expected to load.
