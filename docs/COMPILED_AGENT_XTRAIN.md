# Compiled Agent XTRAIN

> Status: validator-gated compiled-agent XTRAIN cycle with learned route and grounded-answer artifacts, updated 2026-03-29.

## Why This Exists

The compiled-agent learning loop is only real if replay samples can produce
candidate module revisions that are then gated by independent validators before
promotion.

This first cycle stays deliberately narrow:

- `route`
- `grounded_answer`

## Candidate Revisions

Route candidate:

- `compiled_agent.route.multinomial_nb_v1`

Grounded-answer candidate:

- `compiled_agent.grounded_answer.multinomial_nb_v1`

Stronger bounded families under comparison:

- `compiled_agent.route.tfidf_centroid_v1`
- `compiled_agent.grounded_answer.tfidf_centroid_v1`

## Validator Inputs

- independent module eval surface from `crates/psionic-eval/src/compiled_agent_module_eval.rs`
- replay bundle from `fixtures/compiled_agent/compiled_agent_replay_bundle_v1.json`
- held-out learning-receipt rows from
  `fixtures/compiled_agent/compiled_agent_learning_receipts_v1.json`

## Evidence Boundary

The bounded loop now retains explicit `evidence_class` values across:

- learning receipts
- replay samples and replay bundles
- independent module-eval reports
- the XTRAIN cycle receipt
- the promoted-artifact contract
- decentralized-role receipts

The current phase-three stack is still `learned_lane` only.

Validator and contract generation now refuse silent mixing between
`learned_lane` and `stronger_evidence_lane` rows. That keeps the current loop
Tassadar-ready without letting later exact-execution evidence rewrite what the
learned compiled-agent slice actually proved.

## Current Truth

- route candidate is a replay-trained route model artifact, not a hand-authored
  keyword guard
- route candidate clears the retained negated-route false-positive case and
  improves replay matches `14 -> 19`
- route candidate no longer promotes on the widened held-out split because the
  comparison row
  `receipt.compiled_agent.learning.openagents_wallet_provider_compare_heldout_receipt_v1`
  exposed a real ambiguity regression; held-out matches stay `8 -> 8`
- grounded-answer candidate is a replay-trained fact-only model artifact, not a
  rule revision
- grounded-answer candidate improves replay fidelity `13 -> 19`
- grounded-answer candidate also improves held-out fidelity `7 -> 11`
- grounded-answer candidate continues to pass the independent
  insufficient-facts and conflicting-facts fallback rows
- learned route and grounded artifacts are now normalized through JSON
  roundtrip before their digest is stamped, so the retained artifact digests,
  persisted fixtures, and runtime-loaded payloads all agree
- sanitized runtime receipts now feed the same learning ledger and replay
  bundle instead of living in a separate runtime-only path
- the promoted-artifact contract now hydrates the retained grounded-answer
  artifact fixture and keeps route authority on the baseline revision when the
  validator says `hold`
- confidence bands, human-review triggers, and rollback thresholds are now
  retained as machine-readable artifacts instead of living only in issue text
- promoted-versus-candidate disagreement harvesting is now part of the normal
  xtrain loop, including admitted-family runtime shadow traces
- promoted and candidate module authority is exported through a retained
  runtime-consumable artifact contract instead of only being implied by docs
- the first pre-network decentralized improvement roles are typed retained
  contracts and receipts rather than roadmap-only nouns
- those same decentralized roles now rerun as a retained boring dry run over
  the stricter bounded corpus and runtime-ingested receipts without weakening
  validator or rollback discipline
- the first outside-compatible benchmark pack now emits external contributor
  receipts in the same bounded ledger shape, with one retained review-required
  negated-wallet row to keep the current route weakness visible
- external benchmark runs, runtime disagreement receipts, and replay proposals
  can now enter a retained staging ledger and quarantine report without
  weakening the evidence-versus-authority boundary
- stronger bounded candidate families can now be evaluated against the same
  route and grounded-answer contracts without changing the runtime interface
- the retained stronger-family report now keeps the incumbent NB candidates on
  both modules because the TF-IDF centroid family only tied the widened eval,
  replay, and held-out surfaces

## Scope Boundary

This makes the training loop more real, but it does not silently claim runtime
promotion in `openagents`.

- `psionic` now trains and retains a route-model artifact from the replay bundle
- validator-gated XTRAIN evaluates that artifact as the route candidate and can
  honestly keep it in shadow-only `hold` state when widened evidence says not
  to promote
- `psionic` now also publishes a retained promoted-artifact contract for runtime
  consumers
- runtime adoption into the compiled-agent authority lane remains a separate
  `openagents` promotion step

## Entry Point

Regenerate the canonical validator outputs:

```bash
cargo run -q -p psionic-train --bin compiled_agent_xtrain_loop
```

This is the first real bounded XTRAIN loop for the compiled-agent path. It does
not try to mutate the whole system at once, and it does not make Tassadar a
blocker.
