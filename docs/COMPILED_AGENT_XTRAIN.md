# Compiled Agent XTRAIN

> Status: first validator-gated compiled-agent XTRAIN cycle, updated 2026-03-28.

## Why This Exists

The compiled-agent learning loop is only real if replay samples can produce
candidate module revisions that are then gated by independent validators before
promotion.

This first cycle stays deliberately narrow:

- `route`
- `grounded_answer`

## Candidate Revisions

Route candidate:

- `compiled_agent.route.multinomial_nb_v1`

Grounded-answer candidate:

- `compiled_agent.grounded_answer.rule_v2.recent_earnings`

## Validator Inputs

- independent module eval surface from `crates/psionic-eval/src/compiled_agent_module_eval.rs`
- replay bundle from `fixtures/compiled_agent/compiled_agent_replay_bundle_v1.json`

## Canonical Fixtures

- `fixtures/compiled_agent/compiled_agent_route_model_v1.json`
- `fixtures/compiled_agent/compiled_agent_route_candidate_module_eval_report_v1.json`
- `fixtures/compiled_agent/compiled_agent_grounded_candidate_module_eval_report_v1.json`
- `fixtures/compiled_agent/compiled_agent_xtrain_cycle_receipt_v1.json`

## Current Truth

- route candidate is now a replay-trained route model artifact, not a hand-authored keyword guard
- route candidate clears the retained negated-route false-positive case
- grounded-answer candidate keeps the module eval surface non-regressing
- grounded-answer candidate improves replay fidelity on the wallet answer by
  including recent earnings from the receipt-backed facts

## Scope Boundary

This makes the training loop more real, but it does not silently claim runtime
promotion in `openagents`.

- `psionic` now trains and retains a route-model artifact from the replay bundle
- validator-gated XTRAIN evaluates that artifact as the route candidate
- runtime adoption into the compiled-agent authority lane remains a separate
  promotion step

## Entry Point

Regenerate the canonical validator outputs:

```bash
cargo run -q -p psionic-train --bin compiled_agent_xtrain_loop
```

This is the first real bounded XTRAIN loop for the compiled-agent path. It does
not try to mutate the whole system at once, and it does not make Tassadar a
blocker.
