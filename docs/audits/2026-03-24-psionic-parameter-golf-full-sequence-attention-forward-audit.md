# Psionic Parameter Golf Full-Sequence Attention Forward Audit

> Status: written 2026-03-24 after landing the bounded full-sequence causal
> attention forward path in
> `crates/psionic-backend-cuda/src/kernels/quantized_matvec.cu`,
> `crates/psionic-backend-cuda/src/lib.rs`, and rerunning the local validation

## Summary

The admitted Parameter Golf forward path no longer runs causal self-attention
through the old host-orchestrated token loop.

The CUDA backend now executes the admitted rank-4 grouped-query attention lane
through one full-sequence causal kernel for both contiguous `f32` and
contiguous `bf16` query, key, value, and output tensors.

This changes the current honest bottleneck split:

- the admitted forward runtime is no longer dominated by the per-position
  `attention_decode(...)` host loop
- the remaining dominant train-path slowness still lives in backward replay
  plus the later validation-structure issues tracked separately

## What Changed

`execute_scaled_dot_product_attention_step(...)` in
`crates/psionic-backend-cuda/src/lib.rs` now dispatches admitted Parameter Golf
attention shapes to the new CUDA sequence kernel instead of:

- packing one token into scratch
- calling `attention_decode(...)`
- scattering one token back out
- copying one cache row per position

The new bounded kernel keeps the existing public boundary explicit:

- causal only
- rank-4 only
- grouped-query head posture only
- matching batch and sequence extents only
- sequence lengths bounded by the existing public max
- baseline `1/sqrt(head_dim)` scale only

Unsupported shapes still fail explicitly instead of silently widening support.

## Local Evidence

The pre-change committed bounded validation comparison receipt in
`fixtures/parameter_golf/reports/parameter_golf_validation_runtime_comparison.json`
recorded:

- legacy average batch time: `7574.50 ms`
- device-resident average batch time: `7392.00 ms`

After the full-sequence attention kernel landed, the same bounded comparison
harness on the same RTX 4080 node produced
`fixtures/parameter_golf/reports/parameter_golf_validation_runtime_comparison_sequence_attention.json`
with:

- legacy average batch time: `3439.00 ms`
- device-resident average batch time: `3253.50 ms`

That means the bounded same-node validation comparison moved by:

- `7574.50 ms -> 3439.00 ms` on the legacy lane
- `7392.00 ms -> 3253.50 ms` on the device-resident lane

This is large enough to attribute the improvement to the forward runtime
change, not to receipt noise.

## What This Proves

- the admitted Parameter Golf forward hot path is no longer using the old
  per-position decode loop
- the forward runtime improvement is measurable on the local CUDA node even
  before a new H100 rerun
- the eval-stack work that follows now has a cleaner substrate to build on

## What It Does Not Prove

This audit does not close the H100-facing acceptance bar by itself.

It does not prove:

- the exact H100 improvement for `#482`
- the final single-H100 validation wallclock after all validation-structure
  work lands
- anything about the remaining backward replay cost

Those still require fresh H100 receipts.
