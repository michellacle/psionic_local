# Parameter Golf 8xH100 Score-Path Audit

Date: 2026-03-25

## Contract

The upstream Parameter Golf contract is explicit:

- record-track training must complete in under `600` seconds on `8xH100`
- record-track evaluation has a separate `600` second budget
- the public score is FineWeb validation `bits_per_byte`

The current public scoreboard in [`~/code/parameter-golf/records/track_10min_16mb/`](../../../parameter-golf/records/track_10min_16mb) is already below `1.13 val_bpb`, with the best local record surface at the time of this audit showing `1.119400` for `2026-03-23_LeakyReLU_LegalTTT_ParallelMuon`.

That public top record also reports:

- about `83.4 ms` per training step
- about `7,185` steps inside the `600` second training budget
- about `410` seconds for the legal score-first TTT overlay inside the separate eval budget

Psionic is not close to that score path yet. The current gap is not only model quality. The current `8xH100` execution topology is too slow to produce a valid scoreboard-grade run.

Update after the first `#545` implementation slice:

- the shipped distributed runtime now owns a persistent `WORLD_SIZE=8` worker
  mesh
- the hot train path now uses in-memory loopback reduction instead of
  per-rank gradient `safetensors`
- the hot validation path now reuses those same resident workers

That closes the runtime-design gap identified below. It does not yet prove
scoreboard-grade wallclock. Fresh retained `8xH100` receipts are still required
before Psionic can claim that this design materially improved public-lane
throughput.

Update after the first live `/tmp` relaunch attempt:

- the current-bundle launcher was still shipping the stale committed runtime
  fixture digest
  `325b1bb8cd1298be53c111573c05c0b6a9d5a79878a599757301e10ccff76dae`
- that stale payload still emitted per-rank gradient artifacts and `~84s`
  first-step wallclock
- the runtime source changes on `main` were therefore not the code that
  reached hardware
- the refreshed pod-built fixture digest is now
  `e258447ff87703e92d982ec84b290132d3df5a9e95feeed7264f0779a283f8ef`

This does not remove the throughput gap. It removes one false signal source.
Until the committed shipped runtime payload is refreshed, pod-side scoreproofs
do not measure current repo runtime code.

## Current Evidence

### 1. Operator and input binding are now real

Retained RunPod proof root:

- `/workspace/parameter-golf-runpod/parameter-golf-runpod-scoreproof-20260325T091348Z`

What this run proves:

- `pre_training` completed successfully
- immutable PGOLF inputs were bound correctly from the retained materialization report
- the exported-folder `distributed_8xh100_train` mode crossed the old missing-env/operator failures
- the shipped runtime entered the real distributed benchmark root at:
  - `.../parameter-golf-distributed-8xh100-run/benchmark/`

This closes the old operator/input gap. That work now belongs in the closed issue `#544`.

### 2. The current distributed proof topology is now multi-step, but it is still catastrophically slow

Earlier retained proof root:

- `/workspace/parameter-golf-runpod/parameter-golf-runpod-scoreproof-20260325T091348Z`

That older root retained one-step rank-local wallclock in the `217s..229s` range.

Fresh current-bundle proof root:

- `/tmp/parameter-golf-runpod/parameter-golf-runpod-scoreproof-20260325T121903Z`

Fresh retained rank-0 train-step receipts from that root:

- `step_00001`: `observed_wallclock_ms=92839`
- `step_00002`: `observed_wallclock_ms=89203`
- `step_00003`: `observed_wallclock_ms=81437`

Fresh retained rank-0 phase timings:

- `step_00001`: `forward_loss_cuda_ms=58931`, `backward_cuda_ms=33053`
- `step_00002`: `forward_loss_cuda_ms=58426`, `backward_cuda_ms=29797`
- `step_00003`: `forward_loss_cuda_ms=50082`, `backward_cuda_ms=30082`

The retained aggregated gradient artifact is:

- `.../benchmark/runtime_train_step_gradients/aggregated_step_1.safetensors`
- size: about `66 MB`

This is real improvement relative to the earlier one-step proof root, and it proves the repeated loop is live through `step_00003`.

It is still catastrophically slow relative to the public score path. The public top record reports `83.4 ms` per step. Psionic is still at `81.4 s` on the freshest retained rank-0 step. That is roughly three orders of magnitude away from the competitive runtime posture.

### 3. The current proof topology still uses expensive orchestration

The current `8xH100` runtime path still does all of the following in the hot path:

- parent process spawns `8` runtime child processes for the train step
- parent writes per-rank window JSON before the step
- each child exports one per-rank gradient `safetensors` artifact
- parent waits for all children, then reopens every gradient artifact on disk
- parent aggregates gradients on host
- parent applies the optimizer step on host
- parent later spawns `8` more runtime child processes for validation

This is the wrong topology for scoreboard-grade throughput.

It is useful as a retained proof lane. It is not a viable steady-state record lane.

### 4. Prior retained validation evidence was already too slow

The earlier real distributed validation proof documented on `#510` had only reached roughly `30..36 / 119` validation batches per rank after about `27..28` minutes.

That earlier evidence matters because it shows the validation path is also not just “missing a few receipts.” The old distributed validation path was materially too slow for the `600` second scoreboard budget.

## Structural Gaps

### Gap A: spawn-per-step worker lifecycle

At the time of the retained evidence above, the distributed runtime still
launched fresh child processes per step and again per validation pass.

That forces:

- process startup overhead
- fresh CUDA runtime setup
- fresh model reconstruction in every child
- repeated benchmark-root file IO in the hot path

The scoreboard lane needs persistent rank workers, not repeated process fanout.
That worker-mesh seam now exists in repo code, but it still needs live
`8xH100` receipts.

### Gap B: file-artifact gradient synchronization

At the time of the retained evidence above, the runtime still synchronized one
step through per-rank gradient files plus one parent-side aggregation pass.

That means the hot path still depends on:

- writing eight gradient artifacts
- reopening eight gradient artifacts
- host-side aggregation
- only then moving to the next step

This is not comparable to the upstream `torch.distributed` all-reduce posture.
The repo now owns an in-memory loopback reduction seam for the persistent mesh,
but that still needs measured proof and later device-collective replacement.

### Gap C: repeated training is now real, but still not close to score-path throughput

The current `8xH100` runtime now executes repeated steps under the wallclock-bounded source loop.

That closes the old one-step-only boundary. It does not close the score-path throughput boundary.

The upstream loop in `train_gpt.py` still:

- keeps model and optimizer state resident
- advances steps until the wallclock cap is reached
- then runs final roundtrip validation

Without competitive step throughput, Psionic still does not own a valid scoreboard-grade training run.

### Gap D: final artifact semantics are still wrong for real training

The exported-folder completion path still binds the static shipped `final_model.int8.ptz` from the package manifest.

That is not sufficient for a real training run. A real score path must:

- export the trained final artifact from the live runtime
- bind the completion receipt to that exact trained artifact digest and size
- evaluate the trained roundtrip artifact, not the stale packaged fixture artifact

### Gap E: validation still needs the same persistent-runtime treatment

Even after sliding-window scoring landed, the distributed validation path still uses spawned children and full per-child model reconstruction.

That is not viable for the `600` second eval budget if it remains the final design.

### Gap F: shipped runtime payload freshness is a separate correctness boundary

The operator lane packages the committed runtime fixture binary, not the local
source tree.

That means:

- runtime code changes can land on `main`
- local tests can pass against source
- but the pod can still run an older shipped runtime binary

This is a correctness problem, not just operator inconvenience. It can make a
live `8xH100` proof look like a runtime-regression result when the pod never
executed the new runtime in the first place.

## What This Means

Two conclusions are now defensible:

1. The current operator lane is no longer the main blocker.
2. A simple `while elapsed < 600s` wrapper around the current one-step proof will not produce a solid score.

The next score-path work must change the runtime topology, not just the receipt surface.

## Required Path Forward

### Priority 1: persistent distributed worker mesh

Replace the spawn-per-step proof lane with one persistent `WORLD_SIZE=8` runtime mesh that:

- launches the rank workers once
- keeps model and optimizer state resident across steps
- keeps step-local graph state warm
- exposes one coordinator path for stop conditions and finalization

### Priority 2: in-memory gradient synchronization

Replace per-rank gradient artifact export in the hot path with a real distributed synchronization path:

- collective or equivalent in-memory reduction
- no per-step gradient `safetensors` roundtrip in the score lane
- no parent-side file reopen and host reduction in the score lane

### Priority 3: real wallclock-capped repeated training loop with competitive step throughput

Once the persistent mesh exists, implement the actual public challenge loop:

- repeated steps under `MAX_WALLCLOCK_SECONDS=600`
- learning-rate / warmdown behavior tied to elapsed wallclock
- final stop when the cap is reached
- measured repeated-step receipt surface instead of one-step-only proof receipts

### Priority 4: trained final artifact closure

The distributed runtime must export the real trained final artifact from the live run and bind:

- final artifact path
- final artifact digest
- final artifact size
- final distributed validation metrics

to one honest completion receipt.

### Priority 5: shipped runtime freshness checks

The score lane needs an explicit freshness contract between runtime source and
the committed shipped runtime fixture:

- rebuild the shipped runtime fixture whenever runtime behavior changes
- bind the fixture digest into the launch receipt
- fail fast when the launched bundle digest does not match the expected
  current shipped digest for the scoreproof

### Priority 5: scoreboard-grade validation and later TTT

Only after the runtime topology is fast enough should Psionic spend serious effort on:

- sliding-window scoreboard tuning
- legal score-first TTT
- model-architecture and schedule improvements aimed at matching the public top entries

Those improvements matter for score quality. They do not remove the current execution bottleneck.

## Issue Mapping

The current open issue stack only partially captures this.

Existing relevant issues:

- `#510`: real distributed validation and aggregation
- `#512`: exported-folder completion and receipt closure
- `#541`: scoreboard-grade sliding-window evaluation
- `#543`: real `600` second multi-step `8xH100` loop
- `#545`: persistent distributed worker mesh
- `#546`: scoreboard-grade full-sequence attention kernels
- `#547`: retained activation and primal volume
- `#549`: resident train-path model surface
- `#550`: distributed legal score-first TTT
- `#551`: parameter-banked PGOLF model surface
- `#552`: Parallel Muon collectives
- `#556`: `LeakyReLU(0.5)^2` MLP activation support
- `#557`: `BigramHash`-style context features

The open issue stack is now explicit about four additional competitive-path gaps that were not tracked when this audit was first written:

- Parameter Banking in the model surface
- Parallel Muon collectives in the distributed optimizer path
- `LeakyReLU(0.5)^2` in the PGOLF MLP activation surface
- `BigramHash`-style local context features

## Bottom Line

Psionic now has a real RunPod `8xH100` operator lane, a real repeated-step
distributed proof path, and an in-repo persistent-worker score-path seam.

Psionic still does not have a fresh retained `8xH100` receipt proving
scoreboard-grade throughput.

The next serious work is not another operator fix. It is proving that the new
persistent runtime materially lowers training and validation wallclock on real
hardware, then retiring the remaining collective and kernel bottlenecks.
