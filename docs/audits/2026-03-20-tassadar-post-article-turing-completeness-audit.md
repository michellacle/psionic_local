# Tassadar Post-Article Turing-Completeness Rebase Audit

Date: 2026-03-20

## Purpose

This audit reviews the older Tassadar universality and Turing-completeness
scaffold after the newer post-`TAS-156A` article-equivalence wave.

It answers two separate questions:

1. What from the older `TAS-141` and `TAS-150` through `TAS-156` tranche is
   still real and still honest?
2. What still has to land after `TAS-186` if the goal is not merely
   article-equivalent closure, but a truthful statement that the new canonical
   owned Transformer route is the route that carries the repo's
   Turing-completeness story?

## Executive Verdict

Current audit verdict:

- historical `TCM.v1` universality scaffold: `implemented`
- canonical post-`TAS-156A` article-equivalence route: `implemented` through
  `TAS-181`, `partial` through `TAS-186`
- Turing-completeness claim rebased onto the canonical owned Transformer route:
  `planned`
- post-`TAS-186` universality bridge written with an explicit future
  plugin-capability boundary: `planned`
- served/public universality on the new route: `partial_outside_psionic`

The important distinction is this:

The repo already has one coherent bounded Turing-completeness closeout under
declared `TCM.v1` semantics for theory and operator use. That closeout is still
internally consistent and still honest on its own terms.

What the repo does **not** yet have is a proof that the newer canonical
`psionic-transformer` article-equivalence route is itself the route that closes
that Turing-completeness story. The old closeout and the new article wave are
not the same lane, and they were not updated together.

## What Is Already Real And Still Valid

The older universality scaffold was not invalidated by the later article work.
The following facts remain `implemented`:

- `TAS-141`:
  one disclosure-safe effective-unbounded claim boundary exists, and it stays
  suppressed until broad portability, publication, and specialization-safety
  rows are green.
- `TAS-150`:
  one explicit pre-closeout universality boundary exists, and it correctly
  records that broadness-adjacent work did not itself equal a terminal
  Turing-completeness claim.
- `TAS-151`:
  `TCM.v1` exists as one declared universal substrate model with explicit
  control, memory, continuation, and effect-boundary rows.
- `TAS-152`:
  one explicit universal-machine witness construction exists over `TCM.v1`.
- `TAS-153`:
  one dedicated universality witness suite exists.
- `TAS-154`:
  one minimal universal-substrate acceptance gate exists.
- `TAS-155`:
  one explicit theory/operator/served verdict split exists.
- `TAS-156`:
  one bounded Turing-completeness closeout audit exists with
  `theory=green`, `operator=green`, and `served=suppressed`.

That older closeout is also disciplined in the right way:

- it does not imply arbitrary Wasm execution
- it does not imply broad served internal compute
- it does not imply public universality publication
- it does not imply settlement-qualified universality closure

Those refusal boundaries are still the right ones.

## What Changed After `TAS-156A`

The later article-equivalence wave changed the canonical truth carrier for the
article story.

The repo now has a separate post-`TAS-156A` canonical path:

- `TAS-160` freezes the owned multi-crate Transformer boundary with
  `psionic-transformer` as the architecture anchor.
- `TAS-163` through `TAS-175` build the real owned article model, trained
  artifact, reference-linear proof lane, fast-route selection, fast-route
  integration, exactness closure, and throughput-floor closure.
- `TAS-176` through `TAS-181` freeze the declared frontend/compiler envelope,
  broader frontend corpus, demo-source parity, declared interpreter breadth,
  breadth suite, Hungarian parity, and hard-Sudoku benchmark closure.
- `TAS-182` through `TAS-186` remain open and are aimed at final article
  closure, not at universality rebasing:
  demo/benchmark unification, no-spill single-run closure, clean-room weight
  ownership, cache and activation-state discipline, reproducibility,
  route-minimality, and the final article-equivalence audit.

That means the repo now has two different high-value truths:

- an older resumable operator universality contract over `TCM.v1`
- a newer canonical owned Transformer route for the article-equivalence story

Both are real. They are not yet the same route.

## Where The Old Turing-Completeness Scaffold Is Now Stale

The older closeout is still honest, but it is stale relative to the newer
canonical route in six concrete ways.

### 1. Substrate Anchoring Gap

`TCM.v1` still cites older named internal-compute profile anchors such as
`tassadar.internal_compute.article_closeout.v1`,
`tassadar.internal_compute.spill_tape_store.v1`, and
`tassadar.internal_compute.process_objects.v1`.

It does **not** yet cite:

- the canonical `psionic-transformer` route boundary from `TAS-160`
- the canonical article model artifact family from `TAS-168` through `TAS-169A`
- the reference-linear and fast-route proof surfaces from `TAS-171` through
  `TAS-175`
- the article-equivalence gate and blocker surfaces from `TAS-157` through
  `TAS-186`

So the terminal universality contract is still anchored to the pre-article-gap
operator lane, not to the new owned-route closeout program.

### 2. Ownership And Mechanism Gap

The older universality tranche proves operator-universality under resumable
envelopes. It does **not** prove:

- that the decisive computation lives in the owned Transformer weights
- that hidden runtime-controlled control flow is absent
- that helper modules or retrieval layers are not secretly carrying the work
- that KV cache or activation state are not the real interpreter substrate

Those are exactly the open concerns in `TAS-184` and `TAS-184A`.

### 3. Execution-Posture Gap

The older `TCM.v1` story is explicitly resumable and continuation-backed:

- bounded slice resume
- spill/tape extension
- process objects
- persistent process identity
- session-process profiles

The new article-equivalence wave is explicitly trying to close a different bar:

- no checkpoint restore
- no spill/tape extension
- one uninterrupted owned Transformer execution path
- no hidden re-entry
- no runtime-controlled loop unrolling outside the model

That is the point of `TAS-183`.

These are not contradictory, but they are different contracts. The repo has not
yet written down how they compose.

### 4. Frontend And Breadth Gap

The old Turing-completeness closeout leaned on:

- the broader internal-compute ladder
- VM-style module witnesses
- session-process kernels
- spill/tape continuation kernels

The new article-equivalence wave now has a much sharper declared public
envelope:

- one Rust-only frontend/compiler envelope
- one declared article interpreter breadth envelope
- one fixed generic article-program family suite

The older closeout was never updated to say whether the new canonical owned
route closes universality:

- inside that declared article envelope only
- across a wider operator-only envelope
- or across both, with an explicit split

### 5. Portability And Minimality Gap

The older closeout has bounded portability language, but it does not cite the
new canonical-route reproducibility and minimality surfaces because those do
not exist yet.

That is now the job of:

- `TAS-185`: cross-machine reproducibility matrix
- `TAS-185A`: route minimality audit and publication verdict

Until those land, any attempt to rebase Turing completeness onto the new
canonical route would be premature.

### 6. Final Claim-Surface Gap

The older closeout was allowed to be operator-green specifically because it
stayed separate from the article-equivalence program.

The new final article-equivalence gate at `TAS-186` will decide whether the
canonical owned Transformer route is article-equivalent.

It will **not** by itself decide:

- whether the canonical route is the universal substrate carrier
- whether persisted continuation on that route stays ownership-clean
- whether the old `TCM.v1` closeout should be reinterpreted in light of the
  newer canonical model and route identities

That still needs a second wave.

## What `TAS-186` Will And Will Not Mean

If `TAS-182` through `TAS-186` all turn green, the repo will have one strong
new fact:

The canonical owned `psionic-transformer` route will be article-equivalent
under the declared frontend, interpreter-breadth, benchmark, ownership, cache,
reproducibility, and minimality bars.

That still will **not** automatically mean:

- the canonical owned route is the route behind `TCM.v1`
- the canonical owned route is itself the final Turing-complete operator lane
- the old resumable universality contract has been updated to reference the new
  canonical route
- the canonical owned route is universally claimable without the old
  checkpoint, spill/tape, and process-object semantics

After `TAS-186`, the right statement would be:

Psionic has one canonical owned Transformer route that is article-equivalent
inside the declared article envelope, and Psionic separately still has one
older bounded `TCM.v1` operator-universality closeout under resumable
envelopes.

That is a stronger repo than either lane alone, but it is still not yet one
rebased unified story.

## Recommended Post-`TAS-186` Strategy

The recommended strategy is:

- keep the old `TCM.v1` closeout intact as historical machine-readable truth
- do **not** mutate the meaning of `TAS-156`
- do **not** pretend that article-equivalence alone already rebases the
  universality contract
- add one new post-`TAS-186` bridge tranche that explicitly ties the canonical
  owned Transformer route back into the existing `TCM.v1` theory/operator
  story
- write that bridge so it does **not** hard-code a pure-compute-only terminal
  shape that would have to be reopened for the later weighted plugin-system
  tranche

This is the least error-prone option because it preserves the old claim
discipline while letting the new route become the truth carrier for that older
claim.

## Why A Bridge Tranche Is Better Than Rewriting `TCM.v1`

The bridge approach is recommended for five reasons.

### 1. It preserves existing truthful artifacts

The old `TAS-151` through `TAS-156` artifacts remain correct on their own
terms. Rewriting them would create needless provenance churn.

### 2. It keeps the no-spill and resumable stories separate

Article-equivalence needs the stronger no-spill and no-helper audit.
Turing-completeness for real operator use still naturally lives inside bounded
slices with persisted continuation. Those are different claims and should stay
different.

### 3. It keeps claim scope honest

The bridge can say exactly which part of the new route is:

- direct single-run article-equivalent
- resumable operator-universality-capable
- still suppressed for served/public posture

That is much safer than flattening them into one sentence.

### 4. It avoids forcing the wrong terminal bar

The repo does not need to prove "one infinite uninterrupted no-spill run"
to make a truthful Turing-completeness statement. The older `TCM.v1` closeout
was already honest that universality lived under bounded slices and persisted
continuation.

### 5. It keeps the later plugin-system lane composable

The companion plugin audit shows that the repo already has much of the module,
mount, replay, and policy substrate needed for a weighted Wasm plugin system,
but not yet the plugin-specific manifest, packet ABI, receipt family, or
weighted controller.

That means the universality bridge should leave room for a later bounded
software-capability layer above `TCM.v1`, without implying that plugin
capability is already part of the Turing-completeness closeout.

## Non-Negotiable Bridge Laws

The bridge tranche should freeze two blunt laws early, because both the
rebased Turing-completeness story and the later plugin-system story can drift
if these are left implicit.

### 1. State Ownership Law

The bridge should classify state into explicit buckets:

- weights-owned compute state:
  the canonical owned route remains the truth carrier for the machine step and
  direct compute evolution
- cache and activation state:
  in-run ephemeral acceleration state only, never durable workflow truth
- resumed process-object and spill/checkpoint state:
  declared continuation state with preserved identity and explicit receipts
- host-backed durable state:
  only explicit checkpoint, artifact, queue, or worklist state under declared
  stores and receipts

The important refusal is:

no durable workflow truth may be smuggled into undeclared host helpers, hidden
runtime metadata, or cache-like state and still be described as belonging to
the canonical owned route.

### 2. Control Ownership Law

The bridge should also freeze one blunt rule:

host may execute continuation and capability mechanics, but host may not decide
workflow.

That means the host may:

- reload checkpoints
- advance declared spill/tape or process-object mechanics
- enforce bounds and policy
- execute later plugin capability calls once such a layer exists

But the host may not:

- invent branch choices
- choose retries
- choose stop conditions
- select hidden helper programs
- or quietly become the planner under the cover of resume logic

This is how the repo keeps operator universality under bounded continuation
from decaying into host-orchestrated behavior that only sounds weighted.

## Necessary Work After `TAS-186`

The following follow-on work is `planned` if the goal is to make the new
canonical route fully Turing-complete in an honest and machine-readable way.

The bar here is not:

- one infinite uninterrupted no-spill run

The bar is:

- whether the canonical owned route remains the truth carrier under bounded
  resume, continuation, spill/tape, and process-identity semantics without
  losing state-ownership or control-ownership cleanliness

### A. Freeze The Bridge Contract

Land one dedicated bridge artifact that answers:

- which canonical model id from the article-equivalence wave is now the
  universality carrier?
- which canonical weight artifact digest is in scope?
- which route digest is in scope?
- is universality carried by `ReferenceLinear`, `HullCache`, a resumable route
  family above them, or an explicit split across those lanes?
- which old `TCM.v1` rows now bind to new owned-route evidence, and which still
  bind only to older operator surfaces?
- where future packet-mediated software capability calls sit relative to the
  pure compute substrate, so the bridge does not later have to be redefined to
  accommodate plugins

Without this contract, later universality rebasing will drift.

### B. Prove Continuation Ownership On The New Route

The canonical route needs one explicit audit for resumed execution ownership.

It must prove that checkpoint, spill/tape, and process-object semantics:

- wrap the canonical owned route instead of substituting for it
- preserve canonical model identity and route identity across resumes
- do not add helper-side control flow that would defeat `TAS-184`
- fail closed when resumed execution would leave the declared route or profile
- keep packet-local, instance-local ephemeral, and host-backed durable state
  classes explicit so later plugin execution does not blur continuation truth

This is the most important missing bridge between `TAS-183`/`TAS-184` and the
older operator-universality lane.

### C. Rebind Universal-Machine Proofs To The Canonical Route

The older witness construction must be replayed against the new canonical
owned-route identities.

That means:

- exact proof receipts must cite the canonical post-`TAS-186` model id
- exact proof receipts must cite the canonical post-`TAS-186` weight artifact
- exact proof receipts must cite the canonical post-`TAS-186` route digest
- checkpoint/resume equivalence must remain explicit where resumable execution
  is still part of the operator claim

Until this happens, the old universal-machine proof remains real but not
canonically attached to the new route.

### D. Rebuild The Witness Suite Around The Canonical Route

The universality witness suite should be reissued so the canonical owned route
is the route being exercised, not only the older operator lane.

At minimum that suite should still include:

- register-machine witnesses
- tape-machine witnesses
- VM-style interpreter kernels
- continuation-stress kernels
- explicit refusal-boundary rows

But it now also needs:

- route-identity binding to the post-`TAS-186` canonical model
- ownership-clean resumed execution rows
- negative rows for helper substitution, hidden cache-owned control flow, and
  resume-only cheating

### E. Add A Canonical-Route Universal-Substrate Gate

The old minimal gate should not be silently reused.

One new gate should require:

- `TAS-186` green
- canonical-route bridge contract green
- continuation-ownership audit green
- canonical-route universal-machine proof green
- canonical-route witness suite green
- portability and refusal rows green on the declared machine matrix

That gate is the first place where the repo can honestly ask whether the new
canonical route, not merely the older operator lane, is Turing-complete.

### F. Extend Portability And Minimality To The Universality Lane

`TAS-185` and `TAS-185A` are necessary, but not sufficient.

They need one follow-on extension over the universality carrier itself:

- cross-machine witness-suite replay
- cross-machine resumed-execution parity
- route-drift suppression across resume boundaries
- explicit refusal when portability or minimality fails

The older `TAS-156` closeout already carried portability and refusal language,
but it was not bound to the newer canonical route.

### G. Reissue The Final Verdict Split

Once the rebased gate is green, the repo should publish one new verdict split
for the canonical route:

- theory: whether the canonical route now carries the witness-backed substrate
  story
- operator: whether the canonical route now supports bounded-slice universal
  execution under explicit continuation envelopes
- served: whether any served/public universality widening is allowed

The expected served verdict remains `partial_outside_psionic` unless
`kernel-policy` and `nexus` ownership moves or the user explicitly asks for
that cross-repo work.

### H. Publish A New Final Closeout Audit

Only after the new bridge, proof, suite, gate, portability, and verdict-split
artifacts exist should the repo publish a second final closeout.

That new closeout should say:

- the older `TAS-156` closeout still stands historically
- the post-`TAS-186` canonical owned Transformer route is now the truth carrier
  for the bounded Turing-completeness statement
- served/public universality remains either suppressed or explicitly bounded

### I. Reserve A Separate Plugin-Capability Boundary

The rebased universality tranche should also publish one explicit boundary
statement that says:

- `TCM.v1` remains the bounded compute substrate
- later plugin execution is a separate software-capability layer above that
  substrate, not a silent expansion of it
- weighted plugin control is not implied by theory/operator universality
- plugin capability and served plugin publication will require their own gates
  and verdicts

This is not a request to build the plugin system inside the rebased
Turing-completeness tranche. It is a request to make sure that tranche does not
accidentally preclude the cleaner plugin architecture.

## Proposed GitHub Issue Roadmap

Suggested numbering below assumes the next dedicated post-`TAS-186` tranche
continues the current TAS sequence. If the tracker advances first, preserve the
dependency order and titles, not the exact numerals.

`Tassadar: reserve plugin-capability boundary above TCM.v1`

Summary:

Make the rebase explicitly plugin-aware while keeping plugin capability outside
the bounded compute substrate and outside the universality verdict.

Description:

- declare that `TCM.v1` remains the bounded compute substrate
- declare that plugin execution is a separate software-capability layer above
  that substrate
- keep plugin state classes and receipt identity separate from the core compute
  substrate
- refuse any implication that theory/operator universality already grants
  weighted plugin control or plugin publication

### Suggested `TAS-196`: Publish The Post-Article Turing-Completeness Closeout Audit

Suggested GitHub title:

`Tassadar: publish post-article turing-completeness closeout audit`

Summary:

Publish the final rebased closeout once the bridge, ownership, witness, gate,
portability, and verdict artifacts are all green.

Description:

- state that the historical `TAS-156` closeout still stands
- state that the canonical post-`TAS-186` route is now the truth carrier for
  the bounded Turing-completeness claim
- keep plugin capability and served/public plugin posture out of scope
- preserve explicit refusal and publication boundaries

Supporting material:

- `docs/audits/2026-03-20-tassadar-post-article-turing-completeness-audit.md`
- `docs/audits/2026-03-20-tassadar-plugin-system-and-turing-completeness-audit.md`
- `fixtures/tassadar/reports/tassadar_turing_completeness_closeout_audit_report.json`
- `fixtures/tassadar/reports/tassadar_turing_completeness_closeout_summary.json`

## Current Honest Statement

The strongest current statement this repo can make is:

Psionic/Tassadar has two separate truthful closure surfaces:

- one older bounded `TCM.v1` Turing-completeness closeout for theory and
  operator use under explicit resumable envelopes
- one newer canonical owned Transformer article-equivalence program that is
  implemented through `TAS-181` and remains `partial` on `TAS-182` through
  `TAS-186`

What the repo still cannot say is:

The new post-`TAS-156A` canonical owned Transformer route is already the route
that carries the repo's bounded Turing-completeness closeout.

It also still cannot say:

- that the rebased universality bridge is already written to host a weighted
  plugin-capability layer cleanly
- that theory/operator universality already implies weighted plugin control
- or that a future plugin platform would inherit publication rights from the
  Turing-completeness closeout

Those remain `planned`.

## Final Judgment

The older universality tranche should be treated as `implemented`, not as
obsolete.

The newer article-equivalence tranche should be treated as the new canonical
owned-route truth carrier for article claims, but not yet as the rebased
carrier for the repo's Turing-completeness claim.

The right next move after `TAS-186` is therefore not to rewrite history and not
to over-read article equivalence as universality. The right next move is one
explicit bridge tranche that binds `TCM.v1`, witness proofs, resumable
continuation, portability, and verdict splitting onto the canonical owned
Transformer route without weakening the existing refusal and publication
discipline.

That bridge should also be written so a later weighted plugin system can sit on
top of it cleanly, rather than forcing the repo to reopen the universality
contract just to explain packet-mediated capability execution or software-like
artifact identity.
