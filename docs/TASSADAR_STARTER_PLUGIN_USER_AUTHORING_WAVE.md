# Tassadar Starter-Plugin User Authoring Wave

This document tracks the first published starter-plugin user-authoring wave
above the shared starter-plugin runtime.

The boundary is narrow on purpose:

- the wave is about repo users adding bounded host-native starter plugins that
  actually work across the runtime, bridge, catalog, controller, and weighted
  controller surfaces
- the first-class path remains capability-free local deterministic starter
  plugins
- every surface keeps registration, schema, refusal, receipt, and claim
  boundaries explicit
- completion of this wave still does not claim a public plugin marketplace,
  arbitrary external binary loading, or broad automatic admission

## Implemented

- central runtime-owned starter-plugin registry:
  `docs/TASSADAR_STARTER_PLUGIN_RUNTIME.md`
- bounded authoring contract and template:
  `docs/TASSADAR_STARTER_PLUGIN_AUTHORING.md`
- shared projection and receipt bridge:
  `docs/TASSADAR_STARTER_PLUGIN_TOOL_BRIDGE.md`
- starter catalog and downstream report surface:
  `docs/TASSADAR_STARTER_PLUGIN_CATALOG.md`
- deterministic host-owned workflow controller:
  `docs/TASSADAR_STARTER_PLUGIN_WORKFLOW_CONTROLLER.md`

The wave now publishes one dependency-ordered user-authoring path:

1. add a starter plugin once in the shared runtime registry
2. derive shared bridge exposure from that registry
3. derive starter-catalog exposure from that registry
4. prove one host-owned controller composition case
5. publish the bounded authoring template and scaffold helper
6. keep capability-free and networked authoring classes explicitly separate
7. admit the bounded user-added capability-free path into the canonical
   weighted Tassadar controller lane

## What Is Green

- one central starter-plugin registration source instead of repeated per-surface
  tables
- one proven user-added starter plugin, `plugin.text.stats`, that now runs from
  runtime truth through the shared bridge, starter catalog, deterministic
  workflow controller, and canonical weighted controller lane
- one published authoring contract and one narrow scaffold helper for the
  capability-free class
- one explicit boundary keeping networked starter-plugin authoring manual
  instead of inheriting unsafe defaults from the capability-free path

## What Is Still Refused

- open plugin publication or marketplace closure
- arbitrary external binary loading
- automatic admission of every new plugin into every controller surface
- collapsing networked and capability-free authoring into one default path

## Planned

- future user-added capability-free starter plugins should follow the same
  shared-registry path and reach later controller surfaces without new parallel
  metadata tables
- broader publication, trust-tier widening, or networked-authoring automation
  remain later separate issues
