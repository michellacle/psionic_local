# Compiled Agent Decentralized Roles

> Status: first governed pre-network decentralized compiled-agent role set with
> a retained boring dry run, updated 2026-03-29.

## Why This Exists

The compiled-agent learning loop is now real enough that the first
decentralized roles can stop being abstract roadmap language.

These roles are deliberately narrow:

- replay generation
- ranking and labeling
- validator scoring
- bounded module training

They are governed interfaces over retained compiled-agent artifacts. They are
not claims about broad autonomous workers, open incentives, or validator-free
promotion.

## Canonical Fixtures

- `fixtures/compiled_agent/compiled_agent_decentralized_roles_contract_v1.json`
- `fixtures/compiled_agent/compiled_agent_decentralized_role_receipts_v1.json`
- `fixtures/compiled_agent/compiled_agent_decentralized_role_dry_run_v1.json`

## Current Authority Inputs

The role contract binds directly back to the retained compiled-agent loop:

- `fixtures/compiled_agent/compiled_agent_learning_receipts_v1.json`
- `fixtures/compiled_agent/compiled_agent_replay_bundle_v1.json`
- `fixtures/compiled_agent/compiled_agent_default_row_v1.json`
- `fixtures/compiled_agent/compiled_agent_route_model_v1.json`
- `fixtures/compiled_agent/compiled_agent_grounded_answer_model_v1.json`
- `fixtures/compiled_agent/compiled_agent_route_candidate_module_eval_report_v1.json`
- `fixtures/compiled_agent/compiled_agent_grounded_candidate_module_eval_report_v1.json`
- `fixtures/compiled_agent/compiled_agent_route_tfidf_centroid_model_v1.json`
- `fixtures/compiled_agent/compiled_agent_grounded_answer_tfidf_centroid_model_v1.json`
- `fixtures/compiled_agent/compiled_agent_route_tfidf_centroid_candidate_module_eval_report_v1.json`
- `fixtures/compiled_agent/compiled_agent_grounded_tfidf_centroid_candidate_module_eval_report_v1.json`
- `fixtures/compiled_agent/compiled_agent_stronger_candidate_family_report_v1.json`
- `fixtures/compiled_agent/compiled_agent_xtrain_cycle_receipt_v1.json`
- `fixtures/compiled_agent/compiled_agent_promoted_artifact_contract_v1.json`
- `fixtures/compiled_agent/compiled_agent_confidence_policy_v1.json`
- `fixtures/compiled_agent/compiled_agent_shadow_disagreement_receipts_v1.json`

Every retained authority input in this first phase-three role contract now
preserves an explicit `evidence_class` when that artifact is part of the
learned compiled-agent loop. The current contract and retained role receipts
stay in `learned_lane`. They do not silently absorb stronger-evidence or exact
execution rows.

The retained dry run also binds back to the runtime-ingested side of the same
family through:

- `fixtures/compiled_agent/runtime/openagents_runtime_shadow_compare_receipt_v1.json`
- `fixtures/compiled_agent/runtime/openagents_runtime_wallet_recent_earnings_receipt_v1.json`
- `receipt.compiled_agent.learning.openagents_runtime_shadow_compare_receipt_v1`
- `receipt.compiled_agent.learning.openagents_runtime_wallet_recent_earnings_receipt_v1`

## What Each Role Does

`replay_generation`

- starts from the retained learning ledger
- emits replay rows for route and grounded-answer training
- still requires human review before new rows enter training

`ranking_labeling`

- curates labels and corpus placement over retained receipts and replay rows
- keeps accepted labels explicit instead of hiding them in ad hoc notebooks
- still requires human review before labels become training or held-out truth

`validator_scoring`

- scores bounded candidates against independent module eval, replay, and held-out rows
- emits the bounded XTRAIN receipt and promoted-artifact contract
- is still gate-kept by validator rules and rollback authority

`bounded_module_training`

- trains narrow candidate modules on the locked default learned row
- currently targets route and grounded-answer only
- still queues outputs for validator scoring before promotion

## Retained Dry Run

The new retained dry run proves the governed roles are no longer just typed
contracts plus one-off receipts.

It reruns the same four roles over:

- the widened bounded corpus
- the same retained runtime-ingested learning receipts
- the same promoted-artifact contract
- the same confidence policy and shadow-disagreement receipts
- the same validator and rollback rules

Current retained dry-run truth:

- contract digest:
  `303bf8445d4afbae4a329b2cb9d3b9be8619f77aa1113d9b96fb0b62b2ef81fc`
- role receipts digest:
  `a9bcc9c0f4042c5d690b3ee99ff51bb20d6a29372dc592ba0465d7fecc634dc7`
- dry-run report digest:
  `1895a9d50c00d49261e8e00ccf3cdbca4fa38b098407b29aca8ea5ed3810192a`
- validator discipline unchanged: `true`
- rollback discipline unchanged: `true`

## Local Reference Runner

Regenerate the canonical role contract, retained role receipts, and retained
dry-run report:

```bash
cargo run -q -p psionic-train --bin compiled_agent_decentralized_roles
```

Print the retained dry-run report without rewriting fixtures:

```bash
cargo run -q -p psionic-train --bin compiled_agent_decentralized_roles -- --dry-run
```

Inspect one role and its retained local receipt:

```bash
cargo run -q -p psionic-train --bin compiled_agent_decentralized_roles -- --role validator_scoring
```

Supported role selectors:

- `replay_generation`
- `ranking_labeling`
- `validator_scoring`
- `bounded_module_training`

## Honest Boundary

This is the first governed decentralized improvement surface for the
compiled-agent path.

It does prove:

- each early decentralized role has a machine-readable contract
- each role has retained local receipts
- the governed role set now also has a retained end-to-end dry run over the
  stricter bounded corpus and runtime-ingested rows
- each role links back into the real compiled-agent learning loop
- each role now preserves the learned-lane evidence boundary explicitly so
  future stronger-evidence lanes cannot be mixed in by accident
- validator and rollback discipline stayed intact during the retained dry run

It does not prove:

- open public incentives
- autonomous swarm behavior
- validator-free promotion
- broad decentralized agent autonomy
