# First Swarm Trusted-LAN Runbook

> Status: canonical bounded runbook for the first local mixed-hardware swarm
> lane, added 2026-03-24 after landing the trusted-LAN topology contract,
> launch bundle script, failure-drill bundle, and exact two-node runbook path.

This runbook is the exact operator guide for the first local swarm lane:

- one Mac Apple Silicon host running the MLX Metal contributor plus validator
  and aggregation roles
- one Linux desktop host with an RTX 4080 running the CUDA contributor role
- one trusted-LAN cluster namespace with no internet discovery posture
- one shared `gpt_oss.decoder_lm_head_lora` open-adapter contract

This is intentionally narrower than the broader cluster bring-up runbooks. Use
this runbook when the goal is the exact first local Mac-plus-4080 lane and not
a general cluster rehearsal.

## What This Runbook Freezes

- topology contract:
  `fixtures/swarm/first_swarm_trusted_lan_topology_contract_v1.json`
- failure-drill bundle:
  `fixtures/swarm/reports/first_swarm_trusted_lan_failure_drills_v1.json`
- rehearsal report:
  `fixtures/swarm/reports/first_swarm_trusted_lan_rehearsal_v1.json`
- first swarm workflow plan:
  `fixtures/swarm/first_swarm_live_workflow_plan_v1.json`
- Mac bring-up report:
  `fixtures/swarm/reports/swarm_mac_mlx_bringup_v1.json`
- Linux bring-up report:
  `fixtures/swarm/reports/swarm_linux_rtx4080_bringup_v1.json`
- bundle-materializing launcher:
  `scripts/first-swarm-launch-trusted-lan.sh`
- end-to-end checker:
  `scripts/check-first-swarm-trusted-lan.sh`
- rehearsal checker:
  `scripts/check-first-swarm-trusted-lan-rehearsal.sh`

## What This Runbook Does Not Claim

- no claim that this repo already ships a general mixed-backend trainer
- no claim that internet-wide discovery, elastic world-size changes, or
  configured-peer rollout are part of this lane
- no claim that bundle materialization is the same thing as a live successful
  two-node training run

## Frozen Host Posture

Mac coordinator host:

- node id: `swarm-mac-a`
- host alias: `swarm-mac-a.local`
- backend label: `open_adapter_backend.mlx.metal.gpt_oss_lm_head`
- logical device label: `metal:0`
- cluster endpoint: `swarm-mac-a.local:34100`
- repo dir: `~/code/psionic`
- run root: `~/swarm-runs/<run_id>/mac`

Linux contributor host:

- node id: `swarm-linux-4080-a`
- host alias: `swarm-linux-4080-a.local`
- backend label: `open_adapter_backend.cuda.gpt_oss_lm_head`
- logical device label: `cuda:0`
- cluster endpoint: `swarm-linux-4080-a.local:34101`
- repo dir: `~/code/psionic`
- run root: `~/swarm-runs/<run_id>/linux`

Shared cluster posture:

- namespace: `cluster.swarm.local.trusted_lan`
- admission posture: `trusted_lan.shared_secret`
- admission-token env var: `PSIONIC_SWARM_ADMISSION_TOKEN`
- heartbeat interval: `1000 ms`
- stale-worker threshold: `5000 ms`
- contributor-loss grace: `7500 ms`
- max worker skew: `15000 ms`

## First Command

Validate the exact lane contract and the bundle-materialization launcher:

```bash
scripts/check-first-swarm-trusted-lan.sh
```

If this fails, do not describe the lane as frozen or operator-repeatable.

## Bundle Materialization

Materialize one operator bundle for the exact lane:

```bash
scripts/first-swarm-launch-trusted-lan.sh \
  --run-id first-swarm-local-$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ) \
  --bundle-dir /tmp/first-swarm-local-bundle \
  --manifest-only
```

This writes:

- `first_swarm_trusted_lan_topology_contract_v1.json`
- `reports/first_swarm_trusted_lan_failure_drills_v1.json`
- `first_swarm_live_workflow_plan_v1.json`
- `reports/swarm_mac_mlx_bringup_v1.json`
- `reports/swarm_linux_rtx4080_bringup_v1.json`
- `first_swarm_trusted_lan_launch_manifest.json`
- `first_swarm_trusted_lan_launch_receipt.json`

The launcher stops after local bundle materialization. It does not contact
either host and it does not claim a live run.

## Current Rehearsal Verdict

The canonical rehearsal report now lives at:

- `fixtures/swarm/reports/first_swarm_trusted_lan_rehearsal_v1.json`

Regenerate and validate it with:

```bash
scripts/check-first-swarm-trusted-lan-rehearsal.sh
```

Current verdict:

- recommendation: `no_go`
- why:
  the exact trusted-LAN topology, launch bundle, and failure drills are real,
  but contributor execution, upload staging, validator timing, and aggregation
  timing are still partly simulated and not yet backed by a live two-node
  contribution receipt set

## Exact Per-Host Commands

Mac coordinator:

```bash
cd ~/code/psionic
scripts/check-swarm-mac-mlx-bringup.sh \
  --report ~/swarm-runs/<run_id>/mac/reports/swarm_mac_mlx_bringup_v1.json
```

Linux contributor:

```bash
cd ~/code/psionic
scripts/check-swarm-linux-4080-bringup.sh \
  --report ~/swarm-runs/<run_id>/linux/reports/swarm_linux_rtx4080_bringup_v1.json
```

Coordinator workflow freeze:

```bash
cd ~/code/psionic
cargo run -q -p psionic-mlx-workflows --bin first_swarm_live_workflow_plan -- \
  /tmp/first-swarm-local-bundle/first_swarm_live_workflow_plan_v1.json
```

Coordinator topology and drill freeze:

```bash
cd ~/code/psionic
cargo run -q -p psionic-train --bin first_swarm_trusted_lan_topology_contract -- \
  /tmp/first-swarm-local-bundle/first_swarm_trusted_lan_topology_contract_v1.json

cargo run -q -p psionic-train --bin first_swarm_trusted_lan_failure_drills -- \
  /tmp/first-swarm-local-bundle/reports/first_swarm_trusted_lan_failure_drills_v1.json
```

## Required Failure Drills

The lane is not ready to describe as operator-repeatable unless these four
drills stay frozen:

- stale worker:
  Linux contributor heartbeat exceeds `5000 ms`; validator posture stays
  `replay_required`
- upload disagreement:
  contributor upload manifest digest mismatches the workflow plan; validator
  posture stays `rejected`
- contributor loss:
  Linux contributor departs during the active window; aggregation stays blocked
- uneven worker speed:
  contributor skew exceeds `15000 ms`; operator waits briefly, then replays

The canonical machine-legible drill bundle is:

```bash
cargo run -q -p psionic-train --bin first_swarm_trusted_lan_failure_drills
```

## Stop Conditions

Stop the attempt immediately if any of the following happens:

- the Mac bring-up report no longer emits the MLX Metal contributor receipt
- the Linux bring-up report no longer emits the CUDA contributor receipt
- the workflow-plan digest or membership receipt digest drifts from the
  topology contract
- the upload manifest observed on either host diverges from the workflow plan
- a contributor disappears and the operator cannot replay under the same
  contract

## Claim Boundary

This runbook proves that the first swarm lane now has one exact trusted-LAN
topology contract, one exact bundle-materializing launcher, one exact per-host
preflight path, one exact failure-drill bundle, and one exact rehearsal-grade
bottleneck report. It does not by itself prove that a live two-node swarm run
succeeded or promoted a local snapshot.
