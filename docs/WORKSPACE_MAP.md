# Psionic Workspace Map

This document replaces the old oversized README inventory.

`README.md` is now the short front door. This file is the expanded map for the
main crate groups, canonical docs, and active subsystem lanes.

## Canonical Docs

Read these first:

- `README.md`
  - short project overview and quick entrypoints
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
  - canonical Psionic-wide system spec
- `docs/INFERENCE_ENGINE.md`
  - canonical inference and serving completion bar
- `docs/TRAIN_SYSTEM.md`
  - canonical training-system spec
- `docs/ROADMAP.md`
  - full-library roadmap

Useful lane-specific docs:

- `docs/ROADMAP_PARAMETERGOLF.md`
- `docs/ROADMAP_CLUSTER.md`
- `docs/ROADMAP_METAL.md`
- `docs/ROADMAP_MLX.md`
- `docs/LLAMA_VLLM_SGLANG_INFERENCE_SPEC.md`
- `docs/HARDWARE_VALIDATION_MATRIX.md`

## Design Rules

- Keep manifests, receipts, capability reports, and artifact identity explicit.
- Keep refusal boundaries explicit. Do not hide unsupported paths behind silent
  fallback.
- Keep crate boundaries clean. App UX, payouts, and settlement logic do not
  belong here.
- Treat audits as rationale, not canonical current-state spec.

## Useful Entry Points

### Binaries

- `cargo run -p psionic-serve --bin psionic-gpt-oss-server -- --help`
- `cargo run -p psionic-train --bin parameter_golf_single_h100_train -- --help`

## Audits

`docs/audits/` explains why the program is moving in a given direction and
records closeout truth. It is useful context, but it is not the canonical
current-state spec.
