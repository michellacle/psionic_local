# Qwen3.5 Native CUDA vs Ollama

This document is the canonical comparison matrix for Psionic native CUDA
`qwen35` inference versus local Ollama on this host.

Tracked issues:

- `#606` Scale native qwen35 CUDA lane to beat Ollama on 2B, 4B, and 9B
- `#631` Benchmark qwen35 temperature/top-k sampling vs Ollama and keep Psionic ahead

Shared benchmark rules:

- same host
- same GGUF artifact digests
- same prompt per benchmark mode
- same token cap
- Psionic uses the native CUDA `qwen35` lane
- Ollama uses the local `ollama serve` instance
- decode throughput is reported as mean `tok/s`
- benchmark one runtime at a time for `9b` on this 16 GB RTX 4080 because
  Ollama keeps model weights resident in VRAM

## Sampled Contract

Prompt:

```text
Respond with plain text only. Write 20 numbered one-sentence reasons why GPU decode throughput matters for local inference. Start at 1 and keep going until all 20 are written.
```

Token cap:

- `128`

Sampled settings:

- `temperature = 0.8`
- `top_k = 40`
- `top_p = 0.9`
- `repeat_penalty = 1.0`
- `presence_penalty = 0.0`
- `frequency_penalty = 0.0`
- `seed = 42`
- `think = false` on Ollama

Psionic output-mode evidence on this contract:

- `qwen35_output_modes=[top_k_candidates:40]`
- `qwen35_raw_logits=false`

## Current Notes

- The `0.8b`, `2b`, `4b`, and `9b` rows are ahead on decode throughput on this
  host under both the greedy and sampled contracts above.
- The sampled CUDA lane is bounded, not vague. It uses
  `TopKCandidates { top_k }` only when the request stays inside the exact
  envelope:
  - sampled decode or non-zero effective temperature
  - effective `top_k` available and `<= 128`
  - repeat, presence, and frequency penalties inactive
  - structured-output masking inactive
- Requests outside that envelope still fall back to explicit raw-logit readback
  instead of silently narrowing behavior.
- The 4B row only became correct and faster after fixing the fused
  `ArgmaxOnly` output path. The hot decode branch now routes `Q6_K` output
  weights through `Q8_1` projection plus `argmax_f32` instead of the slower
  generic quantized matvec path.
- The 9B row does not require a separate Psionic fallback path on this host.
  The only extra rule is operational: unload Ollama's resident GPU caches
  before measuring Psionic because Ollama keeps prior model weights live in
  VRAM.
