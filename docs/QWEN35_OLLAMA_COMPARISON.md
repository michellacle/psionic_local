# Qwen3.5 Native CUDA vs Ollama

This document is the canonical comparison matrix for Psionic native CUDA
`qwen35` inference versus local Ollama on this host.

Tracked issues:

- `#606` Scale native qwen35 CUDA lane to beat Ollama on 2B, 4B, and 9B
- `#631` Benchmark qwen35 temperature/top-k sampling vs Ollama and keep Psionic ahead
- `#632` Use bounded candidate decode for qwen35 temperature and top-k sampling

Published benchmark checkpoints:

- greedy matrix checkpoint: `c5bc0ba2`
- sampled matrix checkpoint: `March 27, 2026 rerun after sampler-surface refresh`
- large-`top_k` sampled matrix checkpoint: `March 28, 2026 clean-host partitioned top-k rerun`

Shared benchmark rules:

- same host
- same GGUF artifact digests
- same prompt per benchmark mode
- same token cap
- Psionic uses the native CUDA `qwen35` lane
- Ollama uses the local `ollama serve` instance
- decode throughput is reported as mean `tok/s`
- benchmark one runtime at a time for `9b` on this 16 GB RTX 4080 because
  Ollama keeps model weights resident in VRAM
- the local Ollama `qwen3.5` path on this checkout routes through
  `runner/ollamarunner` and its active sampler surface is the one built by
  `sample.NewSampler(temperature, topK, topP, minP, seed, grammar)`

Benchmark evidence workflow:

- Use `scripts/benchmark-qwen35-vs-ollama-matrix.sh` for full matrix reruns on
  host-constrained CUDA machines.
- The harness emits per-run JSONL evidence with timing, token counts, output
  mode evidence (`qwen35_output_modes`, `qwen35_readback_bytes`,
  `qwen35_raw_logits`), and termination/finish reason fields.
- Use `scripts/report-qwen35-vs-ollama.py` to generate the v2 matrix artifact
  and one-page report that splits comparable rows from non-comparable
  token-divergent rows.

## Penalty-Active Psionic Follow-On

This is not a canonical Psionic-versus-Ollama matrix on this checkout, because
the local Ollama `qwen3.5` runner does not wire repeat, presence, and
frequency penalties through the same active sampler path. It is still a useful
runtime checkpoint for Psionic itself because these requests used to force
explicit dense `raw_logits` readback on qwen35 CUDA.

| `qwen3.5:9b` | `43.27` | The row also stays on bounded candidates without materializing dense logits on the host |

## Current Notes

- The `0.8b`, `2b`, `4b`, and `9b` rows are ahead on decode throughput on this
  host under the greedy contract, the original sampled contract, and the
  clean-host large-`top_k` sampled contract above.
- The sampled CUDA lane is bounded, not vague. It uses
  `TopKCandidates { top_k }` only when the request stays inside the exact
  envelope:
  - sampled decode or non-zero effective temperature
  - effective `top_k` available and `<= 128`
  - structured-output masking inactive
  - `mirostat` inactive
- The runtime sampling surface now honors `min_p` and request-level
  `repeat_last_n` in addition to `temperature`, `top_k`, `top_p`, `min_p`,
  `typical_p`, `repeat_penalty`, `presence_penalty`, `frequency_penalty`,
  `seed`, `mirostat`, `mirostat_tau`, and `mirostat_eta`.
- The generic OpenAI-compatible qwen35 server surface now forwards those same
  controls on `/v1/chat/completions` and `/v1/responses`.
- `repeat_last_n` follows the Ollama-compatible control contract in the local
  sampler and benchmark harness:
  - default `64`
  - `0` disables the penalty lookback window
  - `-1` expands the penalty window to the full available history
- `min_p` remains compatible with the bounded qwen35 CUDA sampled lane because
  Psionic applies it after exact top-k candidate selection on both the dense
  and bounded sampling paths.
- `typical_p`, repeat/presence/frequency penalties, `repeat_last_n`, and
  `mirostat` are supported on the Psionic runtime and request surfaces, but
  they are not part of the canonical Psionic-versus-Ollama matrix on this
  checkout because the local Ollama `qwen3.5` runner does not wire those
  controls through the same active sampler path.
- Native qwen35 structured outputs are also supported now. Greedy no-penalty
  structured requests stay on `TopKCandidates { top_k: 128 }` and use exact
  sparse allowed-logit gather on candidate misses, while structured requests
  outside that envelope still fall back to explicit dense `raw_logits`
  readback. Structured outputs are still a parity feature, not part of the
  bounded-candidate throughput matrix. The qwen35 proxy lane still refuses
  them. The tokenizer-side append cache now also buckets token ids by leading
  char so sparse schema recovery does not linearly rescan the full vocabulary
  when there is no candidate shortlist.
- The local `qwen35_cuda_bench` harness now reproduces native-versus-Ollama
  JSON object and JSON schema requests too through `--json-object` and
  `--json-schema-file`, and the native qwen35 structured path is now replay-safe
  and can stay off dense raw-logit replay on the bounded greedy schema lane.
- Structured-output throughput is still outside the canonical matrix. After the
  leading-char token-cache bucketing pass, the matcher memo-path allocation
  cut, and a clean isolated rebuild on March 28, 2026, the local
  `qwen3.5:0.8b` summary-schema spot check measured native Psionic at about
  `78 tok/s` on the first bounded sparse-gather run and about `162 tok/s` mean
  across a warmed three-repeat pass, versus local Ollama at about `331 tok/s`.
  Psionic published
  `qwen35_output_modes=[top_k_candidates:128,sparse_logits:2,sparse_logits:3,sparse_logits:10]`,
  `qwen35_readback_bytes=5700`, and `qwen35_raw_logits=false` on the sparse
  run. The later warmed repeats stayed on `qwen35_output_modes=[top_k_candidates:128]`
  and hit the token cap without materializing `structured_output_value`, so
  this stays a parity note instead of a canonical throughput row.
- `mirostat` therefore remains a Psionic-side capability note, not a canonical
  beat-Ollama throughput claim.
- Requests outside that envelope still fall back to explicit raw-logit readback
  instead of silently narrowing behavior.
- The 4B row only became correct and faster after fixing the fused
  `ArgmaxOnly` output path. The hot decode branch now routes `Q6_K` output
  weights through `Q8_1` projection plus `argmax_f32` instead of the slower
  generic quantized matvec path.
- The 9B row does not require a separate Psionic fallback path on this host.
  The only extra rule is operational: unload Ollama's resident GPU caches
  before measuring Psionic because Ollama keeps prior model weights live in
  VRAM.
