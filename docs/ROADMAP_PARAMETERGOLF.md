Agent execution instruction: implement this roadmap in dependency order, not by
whichever local benchmark or architecture idea looks most fun first. Freeze the
challenge oracle before widening the model family, keep non-record versus
record-track claims separate, and do not treat a thin Python launcher as proof
that Psionic owns the real training path.

Reference-first instruction: Parameter Golf work must not be implemented from
memory. Choose the reference that owns the layer being changed:

- start with `~/code/parameter-golf/PSIONIC_PARAMETER_GOLF_SPEC.md` for the
  intended Psionic-owned scope and the required claim discipline
- start with `~/code/parameter-golf/README.md` for the current public challenge
  rules, the active leaderboard, and the operator workflow as of 2026-03-18
- start with `~/code/parameter-golf/data/README.md` and
  `~/code/parameter-golf/data/cached_challenge_fineweb.py` for the published
  FineWeb shard layout, tokenizer artifacts, and manifest-driven download path
- start with `~/code/parameter-golf/train_gpt.py` for the current CUDA oracle:
  shard format, exact `val_bpb` logic, 9x512 baseline architecture, optimizer
  split, wallclock budgeting, and int8+zlib export path
- start with `~/code/parameter-golf/train_gpt_mlx.py` for the current local
  Apple iteration path and the challenge-compatible local parity expectations
- start with `docs/ROADMAP.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, and
  `docs/TRAIN_SYSTEM.md` for the canonical Psionic owner split, status
  vocabulary, train substrate, and refusal posture the lane must reuse instead
  of bypass

Psionic-only execution rule: the shipped Parameter Golf lane must remain
Psionic-owned end to end. Do not close roadmap items by training in PyTorch or
MLX and then calling the result "Psionic-backed" because the logs or metadata
landed in this repo. If Psionic does not own the model execution, optimizer
execution, evaluation, artifact export, and acceptance reporting, the issue is
not closed.

## Decision

Parameter Golf belongs in a separate `ROADMAP_PARAMETERGOLF.md`, not only as a
small bullet list inside `docs/ROADMAP.md`.

That decision is deliberate for four reasons:

1. `docs/ROADMAP.md` is the canonical full-library roadmap and should remain
   the answer to "what is Psionic overall?"
2. Parameter Golf cuts across `psionic-data`, `psionic-models`,
   `psionic-nn`, `psionic-train`, `psionic-eval`, `psionic-distributed`,
   `psionic-array`, and packaging or compatibility work, so the challenge lane
   is too specific to keep only as one paragraph in the main roadmap.
3. The repo already uses lane-specific deep dives such as
   `docs/ROADMAP_CLUSTER.md`, `docs/ROADMAP_FM.md`, `docs/ROADMAP_MLX.md`, and
   `docs/ROADMAP_TASSADAR.md`.
4. Parameter Golf needs its own issue queue, rules-accounting closure, and
   record versus non-record claim split without implying that the challenge is
   the whole Psionic training program.

So the structural rule is:

- `docs/ROADMAP.md` remains canonical
- `docs/ROADMAP_PARAMETERGOLF.md` is the Parameter Golf-specific deep dive

## Objective

Build a Psionic-owned Parameter Golf lane with:

- exact reproduction of the current public challenge oracle for data,
  tokenizer-byte accounting, and `val_bpb`
- a compact causal-decoder family in `psionic-models` that matches the current
  public 9x512 SP-1024 baseline before architecture search begins
- a Psionic-owned train loop, optimizer split, artifact export path, and eval
  report path that does not delegate the real work to PyTorch or MLX
- explicit non-record versus record-track packaging posture
- a PR-submittable `records/...` folder export that matches the public
  `parameter-golf` repo contract instead of a repo-local review bundle only
- honest throughput, artifact-size, and accounting receipts for `8xH100`
  attempts instead of inferred leaderboard claims

This is not a plan to:

- rebrand the current Python scripts as a Psionic lane without replacing their
  execution ownership
- treat local Apple iteration as equivalent to `8xH100` challenge closure
- ignore code-size accounting because the Rust runtime lives outside the
  records folder
- claim record-track readiness before the public challenge accounting posture is
  explicit

## Relationship To The Main Roadmap

This roadmap is subordinate to `docs/ROADMAP.md`.

It depends on and refines work already named there:

- Epic 2 semantics and compatibility for tokenizer, layer, optimizer, and
  state behavior
- Epic 4 backend truth and performance for CUDA kernel coverage and honest
  throughput claims
- Epic 5 cluster and execution truth for multi-GPU topology, launch, and
  communication posture
- Epic 6 training, eval, and research for train-loop, checkpoint, artifact,
  and benchmark ownership

This roadmap does not widen product scope in `docs/MVP.md`, and it does not
move ownership boundaries out of `docs/OWNERSHIP.md`.

## Ownership Rules

This roadmap must continue to respect `docs/OWNERSHIP.md`:

- `crates/psionic-*` owns the reusable data, model, train, eval, optimizer,
  distributed, runtime, and artifact-accounting substrate for the challenge
- a thin compatibility `train_gpt.py` wrapper is acceptable only if challenge
  rules force it and only if the real execution is still Psionic-owned
- app UX, provider-market behavior, wallet or payout flows, and authority truth
  stay out of this lane

More specifically:

- `psionic-data` owns dataset and tokenizer contracts, split manifests,
  iteration, byte accounting, and batch planning
- `psionic-models` owns the compact decoder family and parameter-accounting
  metadata
- `psionic-nn` owns reusable layers, losses, optimizer shells, and quantized
  wrappers used by the lane
- `psionic-train` owns the trainer, optimizer execution, checkpoint, artifact
  export, and benchmark receipts
- `psionic-eval` owns challenge eval and acceptance reporting
- `psionic-distributed` plus lower runtime or backend crates own multi-GPU
  execution posture and capability truth

## Challenge Snapshot

As of 2026-03-18, the public `parameter-golf` repo says:

- the challenge runs from March 18, 2026 through April 30, 2026
- the artifact cap is decimal `16,000,000` bytes
- record-track runs must train in under `10` minutes on `8xH100`
- the metric is tokenizer-agnostic FineWeb validation compression in
  `bits per byte`
- evaluation must be self-contained with no external downloads or network
- the repository currently assumes a `train_gpt.py`-style submission artifact
- all submissions are pull requests that only add one new folder under
  `records/track_10min_16mb` or `records/track_non_record_16mb`
- each submission folder must include at least `README.md`,
  `submission.json`, `train.log`, `train_gpt.py`, and any extra dependencies
  required to compile and run inside that folder
- new SOTA record PRs must beat the current record by at least `0.005` nats
  and carry enough run logs to justify `p < 0.01`, unless the README's
  systems-only waiver applies

The current public baseline target is also explicit:

- model shape: SP-1024, `9` layers, width `512`, `8` attention heads,
  `4` KV heads, tied embeddings, sequence length `1024`
- batch target: `524,288` train tokens per step
- eval target: full fixed `fineweb_val_*` split with exact `val_loss` and
  `val_bpb`
- artifact target: post-train int8 plus zlib roundtrip
- current record-track baseline on 2026-03-18:
  `val_bpb = 1.22436570`, code bytes `47,642`, total bytes `15,863,489`
- current notable non-record 4-hour run on 2026-03-18:
  `val_bpb = 1.20737944`, total bytes `15,810,161`

The current CUDA oracle in `train_gpt.py` matters in detail:

- the shard format is a binary header with magic `20240520`, version `1`, and
  little-endian `u16` token payloads
- `val_bpb` uses SentencePiece piece-byte lookup plus leading-space adjustment,
  not ordinary token-count normalization
- the baseline architecture uses GQA, RoPE, RMSNorm, learned residual mixing,
  tied embeddings, and a tanh logit softcap
- optimizer behavior is split across Adam groups plus Muon for matrix-shaped
  transformer parameters
- the reported leaderboard artifact is the int8 plus zlib roundtripped model,
  not only the raw checkpoint

## Current Position

Psionic already has real substrate this lane can reuse:

- `psionic-data`
  - `DatasetManifest`, `TokenizerDigest`, deterministic iteration windows,
    packing plans, data-ingress contracts, and distributed data-feed planning
- `psionic-models`
  - reusable model metadata plus runtime tokenizer support for GGUF-backed
    SentencePiece, GPT-style BPE, and WordPiece families
- `psionic-nn`
  - public `Module` trees, `Linear`, `Embedding`, `RmsNorm`,
    `cross_entropy_loss`, optimizer shells, and eval-oriented quantized module
    wrappers
- `psionic-train`
  - fixed-budget training core, checkpoint and replay truth, reusable
    optimizer math (`SGD`, `Adam`, `AdamW`, `LARS`, `LAMB`), mixed-precision
    policy, distributed optimizer contracts, and model IO
- `psionic-eval`
  - benchmark-package contracts, eval-run state, artifact capture, and
    repeated-run aggregation
- `psionic-distributed`
  - public groups, collective helpers, gradient averaging, tensor-parallel
    wrappers, FSDP-style update helpers, and topology-aware backend mapping
- `psionic-array` and backends
  - a bounded public CPU, Metal, and CUDA array surface, plus backend kernels
    that already include matmul/add and some RMSNorm or quantized helper paths

Psionic does not yet ship the challenge lane itself:

- a bounded local-reference benchmark package, challenge score report, and wallclock, memory, artifact-size, plus train or eval bundle-root receipts now exist, but only for the local-reference CPU lane
- a bounded single-device local-reference trainer now exists in `psionic-train`, with explicit batch geometry, grad accumulation, checkpoint and restart posture, raw safetensors export, and int8 plus zlib roundtrip validation, but it is still a CPU reference path rather than measured challenge throughput closure
- an exact `8xH100` DDP-style receipt lane now exists with topology,
  communication, wallclock, memory, and explicit refusal truth, but the public
  CUDA train path still carries typed blocker notes for decoder-kernel and
  runtime widening
- a first honest non-record runtime package and record-folder output contract
  now exist, with a top-level `train_gpt.py` launcher that executes a shipped
  Psionic payload inside the folder, but the path is still a bounded local-
  reference replay rather than a promoted record-track runtime, so neither
  record-track nor true challenge-PR submission posture is closed yet

## Gap Map

| Area | Current posture | Required Parameter Golf work |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `psionic-data` | `implemented_early` generic manifests, tokenizer digests, iteration, packing, and distributed feed planning, plus a landed Parameter Golf shard loader, local-dir manifest builder, deterministic token-stream contract, SentencePiece byte-accounting LUT oracle, and frozen parity fixtures for shard loading, validation slicing, `val_loss`, and `val_bpb` parity against the public Python and MLX scripts | wire the data and tokenizer contracts into exact eval receipts and trainer ingestion |
| `psionic-models` | `implemented_early` model metadata plus bounded model families and runtime tokenizers, now including a landed Parameter Golf reference decoder with tied embeddings, GQA, RoPE, RMSNorm-without-weight, learned residual mixing, skip weights, tanh logit softcap, stable tensor naming, baseline parameter accounting, and a frozen `train_gpt.py` parity fixture at the public `9x512` shape, plus new named-parameter override and export helpers used by the single-device reference trainer | widen the family toward faster train-time or research variants without losing the frozen oracle |
| `psionic-nn` | `implemented` reusable layers, losses, optimizer shells, and eval-only quantization wrappers | widen or compose the current layer set into a reusable causal-decoder path and add any missing train-time primitive support the lane needs |
| `psionic-train` | `implemented_early` fixed-budget training core, optimizer math, mixed precision, model IO, checkpoint, and replay truth, plus a landed Parameter Golf lane module for the public optimizer split, baseline schedule helpers, exact Muon reference math, a frozen `train_gpt.py` optimizer parity fixture, a bounded local-reference trainer with challenge batch geometry, grad accumulation, checkpoint or restart state, raw safetensors export, int8+zlib roundtrip restore, and a local-reference benchmark bundle builder that emits score, wallclock, memory, artifact-size, and train or eval bundle-root receipts plus a shipped non-record runtime replay path | widen from the CPU reference path to the measured distributed challenge lane and carry the new receipt lane forward to real multi-GPU evidence |
| `psionic-eval` | `implemented_early` benchmark and eval contracts, with a tracking-only lane acceptance checker, a landed Parameter Golf validation eval report used by the local-reference trainer and roundtrip checks, and now a dedicated Parameter Golf benchmark package plus challenge score and receipt contracts | connect the landed receipt lane to real distributed runs, benchmark-package bundles, and leaderboard-facing review without overclaiming local-reference measurements |
| `psionic-distributed` | `implemented_early` public distributed helpers with reference-emulated public collectives | add the real multi-GPU training path we intend to use for `8xH100`, plus honest topology, communication, and refusal receipts |
| `psionic-array` and backends | `implemented_early` bounded CPU/Metal/CUDA public surface, with wider CUDA backend kernels below it, and now a landed Parameter Golf CUDA training coverage report that keeps BF16, RoPE or GQA attention, RMSNorm, residual-mix, Muon, and quantized-export requirement families explicit with a stable blocker list | retire the remaining CUDA train-time blockers by widening the public runtime or kernel path needed for competitive small-decoder throughput without overclaiming the public array surface |
| packaging and compatibility | `implemented_early` for a real non-record runtime package | keep the shipped folder contract honest, add defended counted-runtime and build-dependency posture for stronger payloads, and verify that the exported folder compiles and runs offline inside a local `parameter-golf` clone |

## Strategy

The lane should be delivered in two separate answers:

- Deliverable A: a Psionic-native research and training lane that owns model
  execution, training, evaluation, artifact export, and reporting
- Deliverable B: a challenge-compliant submission lane whose code accounting,
  wrapper shape, and record-folder output are acceptable under the public
  challenge rules and that can be copied as-is into
  `parameter-golf/records/...` for a real PR

We should not assume A automatically solves B.

## Current Sprint Assumption

The current continuation sprint is no longer aimed at another review package.

It is aimed at a real record-track candidate path.

That means the next queue should optimize for:

- a generated folder that can actually be staged into `~/code/parameter-golf`
  as a submission candidate
- the real exported entrypoint and runtime path, not another receipt-review
  shim
- real `8xH100` evidence from that exported folder

For this sprint, a top-level `train_gpt.py` launcher into a shipped Rust
payload is an acceptable engineering candidate path so long as:

- the folder remains self-contained and runnable
- the shipped runtime, helper, and build-dependency bytes remain explicit
- the verifier and replay evidence stay machine-readable

## GitHub Issue Queue

The bootstrap issue queue for this roadmap now exists and is complete:

- `PGOLF-000` / [#159](https://github.com/OpenAgentsInc/psionic/issues/159)
  through `PGOLF-403` /
  [#174](https://github.com/OpenAgentsInc/psionic/issues/174) are closed
- that issue block closed the honest bootstrap lane: oracle parity, bounded
  trainer parity, distributed receipts, non-record review packaging, research
  harness, and explicit blocked record-track contract

The follow-on real-record sprint queue now exists under
`PGOLF-500` / [#183](https://github.com/OpenAgentsInc/psionic/issues/183).

That queue covers `PGOLF-501` / [#184](https://github.com/OpenAgentsInc/psionic/issues/184)
through `PGOLF-703` / [#193](https://github.com/OpenAgentsInc/psionic/issues/193)
and turns the remaining work from "reviewable package" to "record-track PR
candidate" into an explicit dependency-ordered program.

## Epic 0: Governance And Acceptance

### Goal

Freeze the claim boundary before we chase benchmarks.

### Exit Criteria

- the repo has one explicit Parameter Golf claim vocabulary
- record versus non-record posture is explicit
- the lane has one machine-readable acceptance report or checker contract

### Goal

Rebuild the challenge oracle in Psionic before model work.

### Exit Criteria

- FineWeb shard loading is deterministic and challenge-compatible

## Epic 2: Baseline Model And Single-Device Trainer

### Goal

Port the current public baseline exactly before searching for better models.

### Exit Criteria

## Epic 3: Distributed Throughput And Backend Closure

### Goal

Turn single-device parity into honest `8xH100` throughput closure.

### Exit Criteria

## Epic 4: Packaging, Submission, And Research Widening

### Goal

Turn the parity lane into a defensible challenge entry, then widen into
research without losing the oracle.

### Exit Criteria

- one non-record packaging path exists under explicit accounting rules
- the repo has a reproducible research harness for post-parity variants
- record-track packaging remains blocked on explicit public accounting closure
  until the rule story is honest

## Current Blocking Delta To A Real Record-Track PR

The challenge repo now defines a narrower target than this roadmap originally
spelled out.

To be truly "recordable" in the public challenge sense, Psionic must be able
to open a PR that only adds one new `records/...` folder to
`~/code/parameter-golf`, where that folder's `train_gpt.py` and dependencies
actually execute the real submission path in place.

The current delta is:

| Public challenge requirement | Current Psionic status | Why this still blocks a real PR |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PR adds only one new `records/...` folder | Psionic now has a deterministic final PR-bundle generator plus a verifier-backed dry-run against the live `parameter-golf` records contract | This closes the first honest maintainer-facing non-record PR surface, but it is still not a record-track runtime or promotion claim. |
| `train_gpt.py` and any shipped dependencies compile and run within that folder | The current `train_gpt.py` launches a shipped runtime payload and the exported folder now passes end-to-end dry-runs against the live local challenge repo | This proves folder-local Psionic execution, but not yet a record-track training runtime or challenge-speed execution claim. |
| code bytes plus compressed model bytes stay under `16,000,000` | Psionic now counts the shipped launcher, runtime payload, and model artifact against the real exported folder | The current non-record payload fits honestly, but the repo still lacks the stronger defended counted-runtime and build-dependency posture needed for record-track promotion. |
| record-track runs reproduce under `10` minutes on `8xH100` | Psionic has an explicit distributed receipt lane and explicit blocker list | The repo still lacks a promoted submission entrypoint whose folder-local execution has actually produced reproducible record-track evidence on real `8xH100` hardware. |
| SOTA record PRs carry delta/significance evidence or a systems-only waiver posture | `psionic-eval` now ships a typed maintainer-facing promotion receipt and `psionic-train` now carries it in the final PR bundle | This closes the promotion-evidence mechanics, but the current receipt still refuses record promotion until stronger record-track evidence exists. |

That is the difference between the current truthful posture
`non_record_submission` and the stronger claim "we can generate a real
record-track Parameter Golf PR."

## Epic 5: Challenge-Repo Submission Surface

### Goal

Turn the current honest runtime package into a real challenge-compatible
submission folder.

### Exit Criteria

- the repo emits the exact `records/...` folder shape expected by the public
  challenge repo
- the shipped `train_gpt.py` and dependencies execute the real Psionic
  training, export, and eval path inside that folder
- one exported folder can be staged into a local `parameter-golf` clone and
  verified offline without hidden repo dependencies

## Epic 6: Record-Track Runtime And 8xH100 Closure

### Goal

Turn the PR-ready submission surface into a genuine record-candidate runtime.

### Exit Criteria

- the remaining Parameter Golf CUDA training blockers are retired on the
  public submission path rather than hidden behind receipt-only evidence
- one exported folder produces real `8xH100` run evidence from the shipped
  entrypoint itself
- folder-local replay verifies the recorded metric, wallclock, and artifact
  facts well enough for challenge review

On a qualifying H100, that command now also materializes the exact first challenge microbatch and computes a bounded CPU-reference mean loss over a small leading prefix of it. The remaining work is to turn that bring-up seam into the actual Psionic-owned single-H100 training path instead of a refusal-bound readiness report. |

The current evidence is an honest refusal with exact dataset, tokenizer, geometry, wallclock, and blocker facts, while preserving explicit absence of final training metrics and artifact bytes because the command still stops at contract validation. |

## Epic 7: Promotion Gate And PR Submission

### Goal

Turn runtime closure into a maintainer-facing PR path for non-record and
record-track submissions.

### Exit Criteria

- one generated folder is PR-ready for `records/track_non_record_16mb`
- one generated folder is PR-ready for `records/track_10min_16mb` once the
  metric bar is actually met
- record promotion carries the public README-required delta/significance
  evidence or a systems-only waiver justification

## Epic 8: Concrete Post-Parity Architecture Queue

### Goal

Turn the research harness into one concrete, bounded architecture queue without
weakening baseline or record-track claim posture.

### Exit Criteria

- one committed queue report exists under the canonical research harness
- each queue row has one explicit mechanism and one bounded claim posture
- implemented rows preserve metric, artifact-byte, and runtime facts
- locality or restricted-attention promotion stays blocked on challenge-like
  evidence rather than toy-window intuition

The first fixed `256`-token window is explicit negative evidence: attention-score terms drop to about `43.7%` of dense, but `val_bpb` worsens by about `0.05037`, so locality is not promoted. |

## Follow-On External And Promotion Issues

### Goal

Carry the first real upstream non-record PR, upstream accounting clarification,
and later record-candidate campaign as explicit tracked work instead of leaving
those steps implicit after the local dry-run lane.

- `PGOLF-202` -> landed challenge optimizer grouping, baseline schedule helpers, exact Muon reference-step parity, and a frozen `train_gpt.py` optimizer fixture in `psionic-train`
- `PGOLF-203` -> landed bounded local-reference trainer, checkpoint or restart posture, raw safetensors export, int8+zlib roundtrip restore, and validation re-eval in `psionic-train` plus `psionic-eval`

### Phase 4: close measured 8xH100 execution truth

- `PGOLF-301` -> landed local-reference benchmark package, challenge score report, wallclock or memory or artifact-size receipts, and train or eval bundle roots for later leaderboard-facing review
- `PGOLF-302` -> landed exact `8xH100` DDP-style topology, NCCL-style collective receipts, analytic memory planning, and measured-or-refused challenge-bar outcomes
- `PGOLF-303` -> landed the machine-readable CUDA training coverage report, stable blocker set, challenge-readiness refusal posture, and distributed receipt linkage for the remaining train-path gaps

### Phase 5: package the lane honestly, then widen research

- `PGOLF-401` -> landed the first honest non-record submission package, counted-byte accounting receipt, runnable entrypoint surface, and record-folder writer
- `PGOLF-402` -> landed the committed post-parity research harness report with one measured baseline control and three guarded candidate families on the same oracle and accounting surface
- `PGOLF-403` -> landed the explicit blocked record-track contract so the remaining runtime, accounting, and `8xH100` blockers are machine-readable

### Phase 6: turn the runtime package into a real challenge folder

- `PGOLF-501` -> landed the compatibility matrix and dry-run verifier against the live `parameter-golf/records/...` contract
- `PGOLF-502` -> landed the true Psionic non-record submission entrypoint path with a shipped runtime payload and runtime receipt
- `PGOLF-503` -> landed machine-readable counted-runtime and build-dependency accounting for the real exported payload
- `PGOLF-504` -> landed the first PR-ready non-record export path that runs inside the public repo

### Phase 7: close real record-track runtime and `8xH100` evidence

- `PGOLF-603` -> landed folder-local replay verification plus exported-folder run-evidence reports for metrics, wallclock, and artifact bytes
- `PGOLF-604` -> landed the first Rust-native single-H100 bring-up command and report seam; turn that seam into the actual Psionic-native baseline trainer path
- `PGOLF-605` -> landed the committed single-H100 parity or refusal report plus local-cache verifier for the Rust-native bring-up path
- `PGOLF-602` -> capture real `8xH100` run bundles from the exported folder itself

### Phase 8: promote and submit

- `PGOLF-701` -> landed the maintainer-facing promotion receipt for delta, significance, and systems-waiver posture
- `PGOLF-702` -> landed the deterministic final PR bundle and checklist for `parameter-golf/records/...`
- `PGOLF-703` -> landed the full local challenge-clone dry run plus committed verifier report

### Phase 9: widen the concrete post-parity architecture queue

- `PGOLF-610` -> landed the first committed concrete queue for post-parity architecture work under the canonical research harness
- `PGOLF-611` -> landed one measured shared-depth decoder value-tying proxy row with explicit metric, artifact-byte, and unchanged-runtime facts
- `PGOLF-612` -> landed one measured mirrored block-pair tying proxy row with explicit metric, artifact-byte, and unchanged-runtime facts
- `PGOLF-613` -> locality or restricted-attention stays open until the repo has challenge-like `seq_len=1024` evidence

### Phase 10: run the first real external submission loop

- `PGOLF-607` -> landed the first real upstream non-record PR and the repo-owned receipt for its exact fork commit, tree hash, and verifier digests
- `PGOLF-608` -> the counted-runtime question is now asked on the live upstream PR, but it still needs an explicit answer or refusal
- `PGOLF-606` -> acceptance-matrix promotion stays blocked on the real public runtime and evidence issues
- `PGOLF-609` -> record-candidate campaign stays blocked on the real public runtime and `8xH100` evidence issues

## Bottom Line

Parameter Golf is a good forcing function for compact-model training, exact
tokenizer-byte accounting, artifact compression, and honest benchmark
packaging.

Psionic is now strong enough to justify a real lane, but the repo should stay
precise about what is true on 2026-03-18:

- Psionic already has strong reusable train, eval, model, tokenizer, and
  distributed substrate
- Psionic now owns the challenge oracle, the public baseline path, and the
  bounded local-reference plus distributed receipt lanes, but it still keeps
  the remaining CUDA train-path blockers explicit
- Psionic now also has a first honest non-record runtime package and a
  maintainer-facing export path for the public non-record repo surface, plus
  exported-folder replay evidence, typed promotion posture, one deterministic
  PR bundle, and one live local-clone dry run, but that is still not the same
  thing as a record-track-ready folder because the exported path is a bounded
  local-reference replay and the stronger shipped runtime-byte story is not yet
  defended for record-track promotion
- post-parity architecture and compression work now has a committed research
  harness plus a first concrete architecture queue, but those candidates remain
  explicitly research-only until new results are measured
- the first truthful result should be parity against `train_gpt.py`, not a new
  architecture
- the next real work is no longer "more bootstrap closure"; it is retiring the
  remaining public CUDA baseline blockers on the exported path and then
  capturing reproducible `8xH100` evidence from the exported folder path that
  now exists
- record-track claims still stay blocked until that path is implemented,
  measured, and promoted, even though the blocked contract is now documented
  and machine-readable
