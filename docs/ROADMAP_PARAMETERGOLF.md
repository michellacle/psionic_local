Agent execution instruction: implement this roadmap in dependency order, not by
whichever local benchmark or architecture idea looks most fun first. Freeze the
challenge oracle before widening the model family, keep non-record versus
record-track claims separate, and do not treat a thin Python launcher as proof
that Psionic owns the real training path.

Reference-first instruction: Parameter Golf work must not be implemented from
memory. Choose the reference that owns the layer being changed:

- start with `~/code/parameter-golf/PSIONIC_PARAMETER_GOLF_SPEC.md` for the
  intended Psionic-owned scope and the required claim discipline
- start with `~/code/parameter-golf/README.md` for the current public challenge
  rules, the active leaderboard, and the operator workflow as of 2026-03-18
- start with `~/code/parameter-golf/data/README.md` and
  `~/code/parameter-golf/data/cached_challenge_fineweb.py` for the published
  FineWeb shard layout, tokenizer artifacts, and manifest-driven download path
- start with `~/code/parameter-golf/train_gpt.py` for the current CUDA oracle:
  shard format, exact `val_bpb` logic, 9x512 baseline architecture, optimizer
  split, wallclock budgeting, and int8+zlib export path
- start with `~/code/parameter-golf/train_gpt_mlx.py` for the current local
  Apple iteration path and the challenge-compatible local parity expectations
- start with `docs/ROADMAP.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, and
  `docs/TRAIN_SYSTEM.md` for the canonical Psionic owner split, status
  vocabulary, train substrate, and refusal posture the lane must reuse instead
  of bypass

Psionic-only execution rule: the shipped Parameter Golf lane must remain
Psionic-owned end to end. Do not close roadmap items by training in PyTorch or
MLX and then calling the result "Psionic-backed" because the logs or metadata
landed in this repo. If Psionic does not own the model execution, optimizer
execution, evaluation, artifact export, and acceptance reporting, the issue is
not closed.

## Decision

Parameter Golf belongs in a separate `ROADMAP_PARAMETERGOLF.md`, not only as a
small bullet list inside `docs/ROADMAP.md`.

That decision is deliberate for four reasons:

1. `docs/ROADMAP.md` is the canonical full-library roadmap and should remain
   the answer to "what is Psionic overall?"
2. Parameter Golf cuts across `psionic-data`, `psionic-models`,
   `psionic-nn`, `psionic-train`, `psionic-eval`, `psionic-distributed`,
   `psionic-array`, and packaging or compatibility work, so the challenge lane
   is too specific to keep only as one paragraph in the main roadmap.
3. The repo already uses lane-specific deep dives such as
   `docs/ROADMAP_CLUSTER.md`, `docs/ROADMAP_FM.md`, `docs/ROADMAP_MLX.md`, and
   `docs/ROADMAP_TASSADAR.md`.
4. Parameter Golf needs its own issue queue, rules-accounting closure, and
   record versus non-record claim split without implying that the challenge is
   the whole Psionic training program.

So the structural rule is:

- `docs/ROADMAP.md` remains canonical
- `docs/ROADMAP_PARAMETERGOLF.md` is the Parameter Golf-specific deep dive

## Objective

Build a Psionic-owned Parameter Golf lane with:

- exact reproduction of the current public challenge oracle for data,
  tokenizer-byte accounting, and `val_bpb`
- a compact causal-decoder family in `psionic-models` that matches the current
  public 9x512 SP-1024 baseline before architecture search begins
- a Psionic-owned train loop, optimizer split, artifact export path, and eval
  report path that does not delegate the real work to PyTorch or MLX
- explicit non-record versus record-track packaging posture
- honest throughput, artifact-size, and accounting receipts for `8xH100`
  attempts instead of inferred leaderboard claims

This is not a plan to:

- rebrand the current Python scripts as a Psionic lane without replacing their
  execution ownership
- treat local Apple iteration as equivalent to `8xH100` challenge closure
- ignore code-size accounting because the Rust runtime lives outside the
  records folder
- claim record-track readiness before the public challenge accounting posture is
  explicit

## Relationship To The Main Roadmap

This roadmap is subordinate to `docs/ROADMAP.md`.

It depends on and refines work already named there:

- Epic 2 semantics and compatibility for tokenizer, layer, optimizer, and
  state behavior
- Epic 4 backend truth and performance for CUDA kernel coverage and honest
  throughput claims
- Epic 5 cluster and execution truth for multi-GPU topology, launch, and
  communication posture
- Epic 6 training, eval, and research for train-loop, checkpoint, artifact,
  and benchmark ownership

This roadmap does not widen product scope in `docs/MVP.md`, and it does not
move ownership boundaries out of `docs/OWNERSHIP.md`.

## Ownership Rules

This roadmap must continue to respect `docs/OWNERSHIP.md`:

- `crates/psionic-*` owns the reusable data, model, train, eval, optimizer,
  distributed, runtime, and artifact-accounting substrate for the challenge
- a thin compatibility `train_gpt.py` wrapper is acceptable only if challenge
  rules force it and only if the real execution is still Psionic-owned
- app UX, provider-market behavior, wallet or payout flows, and authority truth
  stay out of this lane

More specifically:

- `psionic-data` owns dataset and tokenizer contracts, split manifests,
  iteration, byte accounting, and batch planning
- `psionic-models` owns the compact decoder family and parameter-accounting
  metadata
- `psionic-nn` owns reusable layers, losses, optimizer shells, and quantized
  wrappers used by the lane
- `psionic-train` owns the trainer, optimizer execution, checkpoint, artifact
  export, and benchmark receipts
- `psionic-eval` owns challenge eval and acceptance reporting
- `psionic-distributed` plus lower runtime or backend crates own multi-GPU
  execution posture and capability truth

## Challenge Snapshot

As of 2026-03-18, the public `parameter-golf` repo says:

- the challenge runs from March 18, 2026 through April 30, 2026
- the artifact cap is decimal `16,000,000` bytes
- record-track runs must train in under `10` minutes on `8xH100`
- the metric is tokenizer-agnostic FineWeb validation compression in
  `bits per byte`
- evaluation must be self-contained with no external downloads or network
- the repository currently assumes a `train_gpt.py`-style submission artifact

The current public baseline target is also explicit:

- model shape: SP-1024, `9` layers, width `512`, `8` attention heads,
  `4` KV heads, tied embeddings, sequence length `1024`
- batch target: `524,288` train tokens per step
- eval target: full fixed `fineweb_val_*` split with exact `val_loss` and
  `val_bpb`
- artifact target: post-train int8 plus zlib roundtrip
- current record-track baseline on 2026-03-18:
  `val_bpb = 1.22436570`, code bytes `47,642`, total bytes `15,863,489`
- current notable non-record 4-hour run on 2026-03-18:
  `val_bpb = 1.20737944`, total bytes `15,810,161`

The current CUDA oracle in `train_gpt.py` matters in detail:

- the shard format is a binary header with magic `20240520`, version `1`, and
  little-endian `u16` token payloads
- `val_bpb` uses SentencePiece piece-byte lookup plus leading-space adjustment,
  not ordinary token-count normalization
- the baseline architecture uses GQA, RoPE, RMSNorm, learned residual mixing,
  tied embeddings, and a tanh logit softcap
- optimizer behavior is split across Adam groups plus Muon for matrix-shaped
  transformer parameters
- the reported leaderboard artifact is the int8 plus zlib roundtripped model,
  not only the raw checkpoint

## Current Position

Psionic already has real substrate this lane can reuse:

- `psionic-data`
  - `DatasetManifest`, `TokenizerDigest`, deterministic iteration windows,
    packing plans, data-ingress contracts, and distributed data-feed planning
- `psionic-models`
  - reusable model metadata plus runtime tokenizer support for GGUF-backed
    SentencePiece, GPT-style BPE, and WordPiece families
- `psionic-nn`
  - public `Module` trees, `Linear`, `Embedding`, `RmsNorm`,
    `cross_entropy_loss`, optimizer shells, and eval-oriented quantized module
    wrappers
- `psionic-train`
  - fixed-budget training core, checkpoint and replay truth, reusable
    optimizer math (`SGD`, `Adam`, `AdamW`, `LARS`, `LAMB`), mixed-precision
    policy, distributed optimizer contracts, and model IO
- `psionic-eval`
  - benchmark-package contracts, eval-run state, artifact capture, and
    repeated-run aggregation
- `psionic-distributed`
  - public groups, collective helpers, gradient averaging, tensor-parallel
    wrappers, FSDP-style update helpers, and topology-aware backend mapping
- `psionic-array` and backends
  - a bounded public CPU, Metal, and CUDA array surface, plus backend kernels
    that already include matmul/add and some RMSNorm or quantized helper paths

Psionic does not yet ship the challenge lane itself:

- no benchmark-package or eval-receipt lane for the challenge oracle outside the new `psionic-data` fixture parity path yet
- no Parameter Golf benchmark package or eval receipts
- a bounded single-device local-reference trainer now exists in `psionic-train`, with explicit batch geometry, grad accumulation, checkpoint and restart posture, raw safetensors export, and int8 plus zlib roundtrip validation, but it is still a CPU reference path rather than measured challenge throughput closure
- no transport-backed `8xH100` train lane proved at challenge throughput
- no challenge wrapper or record-folder output contract for record-track review

## Gap Map

| Area | Current posture | Required Parameter Golf work |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `psionic-data` | `implemented_early` generic manifests, tokenizer digests, iteration, packing, and distributed feed planning, plus a landed Parameter Golf shard loader, local-dir manifest builder, deterministic token-stream contract, SentencePiece byte-accounting LUT oracle, and frozen parity fixtures for shard loading, validation slicing, `val_loss`, and `val_bpb` parity against the public Python and MLX scripts | wire the data and tokenizer contracts into exact eval receipts and trainer ingestion |
| `psionic-models` | `implemented_early` model metadata plus bounded model families and runtime tokenizers, now including a landed Parameter Golf reference decoder with tied embeddings, GQA, RoPE, RMSNorm-without-weight, learned residual mixing, skip weights, tanh logit softcap, stable tensor naming, baseline parameter accounting, and a frozen `train_gpt.py` parity fixture at the public `9x512` shape, plus new named-parameter override and export helpers used by the single-device reference trainer | widen the family toward faster train-time or research variants without losing the frozen oracle |
| `psionic-nn` | `implemented` reusable layers, losses, optimizer shells, and eval-only quantization wrappers | widen or compose the current layer set into a reusable causal-decoder path and add any missing train-time primitive support the lane needs |
| `psionic-train` | `implemented_early` fixed-budget training core, optimizer math, mixed precision, model IO, checkpoint, and replay truth, plus a landed Parameter Golf lane module for the public optimizer split, baseline schedule helpers, exact Muon reference math, a frozen `train_gpt.py` optimizer parity fixture, and a bounded local-reference trainer with challenge batch geometry, grad accumulation, checkpoint or restart state, raw safetensors export, and int8+zlib roundtrip restore | connect the bounded trainer to benchmark receipts, then widen from the CPU reference path to the measured distributed challenge lane |
| `psionic-eval` | `implemented_early` benchmark and eval contracts, with a tracking-only lane acceptance checker and now a landed Parameter Golf validation eval report used by the local-reference trainer and roundtrip checks | add benchmark-package receipts, leaderboard-facing report packaging, and explicit measured wallclock or memory evidence tied to real lane runs |
| `psionic-distributed` | `implemented_early` public distributed helpers with reference-emulated public collectives | add the real multi-GPU training path we intend to use for `8xH100`, plus honest topology, communication, and refusal receipts |
| `psionic-array` and backends | `implemented_early` bounded CPU/Metal/CUDA public surface, with wider CUDA backend kernels below it | widen the CUDA train-time kernel and runtime path needed for competitive small-decoder throughput without overclaiming the public array surface |
| packaging and compatibility | `planned` for this lane | define the non-record versus record-track wrapper, code-byte accounting posture, record-folder output, and submission metadata path |

## Strategy

The lane should be delivered in two separate answers:

- Deliverable A: a Psionic-native research and training lane that owns model
  execution, training, evaluation, artifact export, and reporting
- Deliverable B: a challenge-compliant submission lane whose code accounting,
  wrapper shape, and record-folder output are acceptable under the public
  challenge rules

We should not assume A automatically solves B.

## GitHub Issue Queue

No Parameter Golf issue block existed in `OpenAgentsInc/psionic` when this
roadmap was written. This roadmap therefore opens the first repo-local issue
queue for the lane.

The GitHub issue queue for this roadmap now exists under
`PGOLF-000` / [#159](https://github.com/OpenAgentsInc/psionic/issues/159),
with `PGOLF-001` / [#160](https://github.com/OpenAgentsInc/psionic/issues/160)
reserved for the roadmap itself and `PGOLF-002` /
[#161](https://github.com/OpenAgentsInc/psionic/issues/161) plus `PGOLF-003` /
[#162](https://github.com/OpenAgentsInc/psionic/issues/162) now closing the
governance baseline for claim language and acceptance tracking.

## Epic 0: Governance And Acceptance

### Goal

Freeze the claim boundary before we chase benchmarks.

### Exit Criteria

- the repo has one explicit Parameter Golf claim vocabulary
- record versus non-record posture is explicit
- the lane has one machine-readable acceptance report or checker contract

## Epic 1: Data And Metric Oracle

### Goal

Rebuild the challenge oracle in Psionic before model work.

### Exit Criteria

- FineWeb shard loading is deterministic and challenge-compatible

## Epic 2: Baseline Model And Single-Device Trainer

### Goal

Port the current public baseline exactly before searching for better models.

### Exit Criteria

- a Psionic decoder family matches the current public baseline shape
- optimizer grouping and Muon behavior are reproduced honestly
- one single-device run can train, validate, export, reload, and re-evaluate

### Issues

## Epic 3: Distributed Throughput And Backend Closure

### Goal

Turn single-device parity into honest `8xH100` throughput closure.

### Exit Criteria

- the repo has one explicit `8xH100` train topology plan
- multi-GPU logs and receipts are preserved as benchmark truth
- the required CUDA runtime or kernel widenings are explicit

### Issues

| `PGOLF-303` / [#171](https://github.com/OpenAgentsInc/psionic/issues/171) | open | `Psionic Parameter Golf: widen CUDA runtime and kernel coverage required by the challenge baseline` | Close the gap between today's bounded public array surface and the kernels or runtime path needed for competitive small-decoder training. This includes any train-time RoPE, RMSNorm, attention, residual, optimizer, or quantization kernels that must be widened for the chosen `8xH100` path. |

## Epic 4: Packaging, Submission, And Research Widening

### Goal

Turn the parity lane into a defensible challenge entry, then widen into
research without losing the oracle.

### Exit Criteria

- one non-record packaging path exists under explicit accounting rules
- the repo has a reproducible research harness for post-parity variants
- record-track packaging remains blocked on explicit public accounting closure
  until the rule story is honest

### Issues

| ID | Status | Proposed GitHub issue title | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `PGOLF-401` / [#172](https://github.com/OpenAgentsInc/psionic/issues/172) | open | `Psionic Parameter Golf: add a non-record submission wrapper and record-folder output contract` | Build the first packaging answer as a clearly labeled non-record lane if needed, including wrapper shape, README generation, `submission.json`, train log preservation, and artifact-byte accounting that does not pretend the Rust runtime is free. |

| `PGOLF-403` / [#174](https://github.com/OpenAgentsInc/psionic/issues/174) | open | `Psionic Parameter Golf: add a record-track submission contract once public accounting is explicit` | Only after the public wrapper and code-size story is clear should the repo claim record-track readiness. This issue owns the final record-submission path, not the earlier research or non-record lane. |

## Current Execution Order

### Phase 1: freeze challenge posture and acceptance (done 2026-03-18)

- `PGOLF-001` -> roadmap and issue queue
- `PGOLF-002` -> accounting and claim-language contract
- `PGOLF-003` -> acceptance matrix, schema, report, and checker

### Phase 2: rebuild the challenge oracle

- `PGOLF-101` -> landed FineWeb shard ABI, manifest builder, and deterministic token-stream contract
- `PGOLF-102` -> landed SentencePiece byte-accounting LUTs and `val_bpb` byte-count helpers
- `PGOLF-103` -> landed frozen Python/MLX parity fixtures plus shard, validation-slice, `val_loss`, and `val_bpb` oracle tests

### Phase 3: port the public baseline exactly

- `PGOLF-201` -> landed compact decoder family, stable tensor layout, baseline parameter accounting, and frozen `train_gpt.py` logits/loss parity fixture at the public `9x512` shape
- `PGOLF-202` -> landed challenge optimizer grouping, baseline schedule helpers, exact Muon reference-step parity, and a frozen `train_gpt.py` optimizer fixture in `psionic-train`
- `PGOLF-203` -> landed bounded local-reference trainer, checkpoint or restart posture, raw safetensors export, int8+zlib roundtrip restore, and validation re-eval in `psionic-train` plus `psionic-eval`

### Phase 4: close measured 8xH100 execution truth

- `PGOLF-301`
- `PGOLF-302`
- `PGOLF-303`

### Phase 5: package the lane honestly, then widen research

- `PGOLF-401`
- `PGOLF-402`
- `PGOLF-403`

## Bottom Line

Parameter Golf is a good forcing function for compact-model training, exact
tokenizer-byte accounting, artifact compression, and honest benchmark
packaging.

Psionic is now strong enough to justify a real lane, but the repo should stay
precise about what is true on 2026-03-18:

- Psionic already has strong reusable train, eval, model, tokenizer, and
  distributed substrate
- Psionic does not yet own the exact challenge oracle or the public baseline
  path
- the first truthful result should be parity against `train_gpt.py`, not a new
  architecture
- record-track claims stay blocked until the actual counted-runtime submission
  path is implemented, not merely documented
