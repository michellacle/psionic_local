# Parameter Golf RunPod 8xH100 Runbook

> Status: canonical bounded RunPod operator runbook for the Parameter Golf
> `8xH100` lane, updated 2026-03-25 after the repo-owned launch profile,
> operator preflight, SSH-capable launcher, live visualization writer, and
> finalizer contract landed.

This runbook defines the current honest RunPod posture for the Parameter Golf
distributed `8xH100` lane.

It is narrower than a completed real `8xH100` run and narrower than a
record-track claim.

## Profile Contract

The committed RunPod lane is:

- profile id: `runpod_8xh100_parameter_golf`
- trainer lane id: `parameter_golf_distributed_8xh100`
- provider: `runpod`
- pod shape: one single pod with exactly `8` non-MIG `H100` devices
- expected execution backend: `cuda`
- declared world size: `8`
- declared grad accumulation steps: `1`
- workspace root: `/workspace`
- declared run cost ceiling: `500.0` USD
- declared runtime ceiling: `4.0` hours

The profile also keeps the operator assumptions explicit:

- the pod is user-provided rather than API-created by this repo
- the workspace is a persistent mount rooted at `/workspace`
- the runtime image is a user-provided CUDA-capable Ubuntu image rather than a
  repo-owned cloud image family
- the immutable PGOLF input-package descriptor is reused from the committed
  Google bucket materialization

## Execution Posture

The committed launcher is explicit about four separate operator phases:

- remote preflight:
  prove SSH reachability, preserve the launch manifest in the remote run root,
  verify the required command inventory, and snapshot `nvidia-smi`

- pre-training:
  validate the workspace contract, bind the immutable PGOLF input descriptor,
  materialize or verify the public FineWeb `sp1024` cache plus tokenizer
  identity under one retained
  `parameter_golf_input_materialization.json` report, then stage the exported
  submission folder directly into the retained
  `records/track_non_record_16mb/<submission_id>` root that later execution
  and finalization consume, after first fast-forwarding the remote checkout to
  the requested Git ref
- execution entrypoint:
  run the exported folder under the public `WORLD_SIZE=8` posture while
  reading the retained input-materialization report to export the exact
  dataset-root and tokenizer-path env vars required by the shipped runtime,
  while also forcing the explicit exported-folder execution mode
  `PSIONIC_PARAMETER_GOLF_EXECUTION_MODE=distributed_8xh100_train`, and while
  emitting the provider-neutral remote-training bundle, run index, and
  append-only snapshots under `training_visualization/`
- finalization:
  generate the exported-folder submission run evidence under the RunPod
  `8xH100` posture, mirror the retained distributed challenge receipt into the
  run root, capture `nvidia-smi` inventory and `nvidia-smi topo -m`, then seal
  the provider-neutral remote-training visualization bundle and run index under
  one machine-readable finalizer report

The launcher now also preserves the remote operator surface itself under one
machine-readable launch receipt plus per-phase logs:

- `parameter_golf_runpod_8xh100_launch_manifest.json`
- `parameter_golf_runpod_8xh100_launch_receipt.json`
- `remote_preflight.log`
- `pre_training.log`
- `parameter_golf_input_materialization.json`
- `execution.log`
- `finalizer.log`

This means later real `8xH100` runs can retain not only the exported-folder
evidence and finalizer outputs, but also the exact remote phase boundary,
phase commands, and per-phase exit results from the launcher that drove the
pod.

When the persistent `/workspace` checkout is stale or blocked by RunPod quota
edges, the repo also carries one narrower fallback launcher:

```bash
bash scripts/parameter-golf-runpod-launch-current-bundle-8xh100.sh \
  --pod-host <host> \
  --pod-port <port> \
  --ssh-key <path>
```

That launcher builds the current exported submission bundle locally, uploads
only the bundle plus the two input-materialization helper scripts and the
committed input contract, stages the run under `/tmp/parameter-golf-runpod`,
and then launches the distributed runtime there. It is the current honest
fallback when a pod can still execute the runtime correctly but cannot keep a
fresh `/workspace/psionic` checkout due workspace quota or stale payload drift.

This explicit execution-mode requirement is intentional. The current exported
folder ships:

- the default bounded local-reference replay payload
- the real single-H100 trainer payload
- a Rust-owned distributed `8xH100` admission, bootstrap, and one-step
  train path inside the shipped runtime payload

The committed Linux replay payload is now the stripped portable binary that was
validated on the real RunPod `8xH100` Ubuntu image. The expected execution
boundary on that pod is therefore the explicit post-train-step refusal from
the shipped runtime, not an earlier libc or entrypoint mismatch.

It still does not ship the later persistent multi-step score path. The RunPod
launcher therefore requests the reserved distributed mode explicitly so the
execution phase writes the machine-readable bring-up report, one aggregate
runtime-bootstrap receipt, retained per-rank bootstrap receipts, retained
per-rank bootstrap logs, one aggregate train-step receipt, retained per-rank
train-step receipts, retained per-rank train-step logs, retained train-step
windows, retained per-rank gradient artifacts, retained runtime-owned
post-step model artifacts, one measured distributed receipt, and then writes
one completion receipt bound to the trained runtime-produced artifact instead
of silently taking the local-reference replay path under `WORLD_SIZE=8`.

The operator lane now also keeps the dataset/tokenizer env contract explicit.
It does not assume the pod has the right values already exported. The
pre-training phase materializes or verifies the committed public cache through
the repo-owned input contract, and the execution phase derives:

- `PSIONIC_PARAMETER_GOLF_DATASET_ROOT`
- `PSIONIC_PARAMETER_GOLF_TOKENIZER_PATH`

from the retained materialization report before invoking `train_gpt.py`.

The finalizer now also resolves the exported submission root explicitly. The
canonical path is still the retained `records/track_non_record_16mb/<submission_id>`
folder, but the finalizer will fail closed only after checking both the
requested path and the retained `${run_root}/exported_submission` root for
`submission.json`. This keeps the operator surface explicit while surviving the
older pre-fix layout during rehearsal.

The runtime-owned visualization mirror now stays explicit in the retained run
root:

- `training_visualization/parameter_golf_distributed_8xh100_remote_training_visualization_bundle_v1.json`
- `training_visualization/remote_training_run_index_v1.json`
- `training_visualization/snapshots/heartbeat_*.json`

The runtime writes those artifacts before distributed bootstrap begins, keeps
them fresh at least once per second while active, and force-flushes them across
bootstrap, train-step, validation, and completion transitions. The finalizer
then seals the same bundle family and writes
`training_visualization/snapshots/finalized_bundle.json`.

When a real distributed receipt already exists in the run root, the finalizer
now passes that exact receipt into the exported-folder evidence generator rather
than regenerating a synthetic `MeasurementsMissing` refusal from posture alone.

When a real distributed receipt does not exist yet but the run root contains
`parameter_golf_distributed_8xh100_measurements.json`, the finalizer now asks
Psionic to build the typed receipt directly from:

- `nvidia_smi_inventory.txt`
- the canonical RunPod `tensor_collective_mesh` capability posture
- the operator-collected distributed timing or memory measurements JSON

This removes the old manual `devices.json` / capability JSON / config JSON
assembly step from the first real RunPod `8xH100` evidence path.

When the measurements JSON is also absent but the run root still preserves
`execution.log`, the finalizer now first asks Psionic to derive
`parameter_golf_distributed_8xh100_measurements.json` from that retained log,
then lifts the resulting measurements plus `nvidia_smi_inventory.txt` into the
typed distributed receipt.

When `execution.log` is a fail-closed distributed refusal instead of a real
training log, the finalizer now skips measurement derivation explicitly and
still seals a retained refusal report with:

- the launcher receipt path and digest
- the execution-log path and digest
- an explicit `execution_log_measurement_status` classification

This keeps the refusal surface machine-readable instead of crashing while
trying to fabricate distributed measurements from a non-training log.

This is intentional. `#460` closes the RunPod lane definition and rehearsal,
not the later real `8xH100` evidence bundle.

## Local Rehearsal

The repo-owned local rehearsal is:

```bash
bash scripts/check-parameter-golf-runpod-8xh100-lane.sh \
  --report /tmp/parameter_golf_runpod_8xh100_operator_rehearsal.json
```

That rehearsal verifies:

- the committed launch profile, cost guardrail, and operator preflight policy
  are internally consistent
- the preflight accepts the RunPod `8xH100` profile locally
- the manifest-only launcher emits a launch manifest that preserves the public
  `WORLD_SIZE=8` posture, the immutable input descriptor, the launch-receipt
  paths, and the finalizer contract

## Honest Boundary

This runbook does not claim:

- a successful real RunPod `8xH100` execution
- final challenge metrics from exported-folder `8xH100` hardware
- challenge-speed closure
- record-track readiness
- that the current exported folder already contains the later distributed
  validation and final execution-closure payload

It closes one narrower but important thing:

- the repo now owns one explicit RunPod `8xH100` operator lane with a
  committed profile, preflight, SSH-capable launcher with manifest-only
  rehearsal mode, launch receipt, finalizer contract, and app-facing
  visualization bundle family that later real hardware runs can reuse without
  redefining the operator surface from scratch
